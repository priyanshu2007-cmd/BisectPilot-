## Methodology

This Python Test Reviewer skill was created through extensive research of authoritative testing resources, focusing on **quality over quantity**. The skill presents multiple testing strategies for each scenario (not just "good" vs "bad" examples), with complete runnable code, trade-off analysis, and recommendations based on established testing principles.

**Philosophy:** Show developers HOW to think about testing, not just WHAT patterns to use.

**Created:** January 2025

- **URL:** https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html
- **Author:** Martin Fowler
- **Published:** January 2, 2007
- **Used for:** Test double taxonomy, state vs behavior verification, testing philosophies
- **License:** Public article

**Key Concepts:**
- **Test Double Taxonomy** (Gerard Meszaros):
  - Dummy Objects - passed but never used
  - Fake Objects - working implementations with shortcuts
  - Stubs - provide canned answers
  - Spies - stubs that record interactions
  - Mocks - pre-programmed with expectations

**Testing Philosophies:**
- **Classical TDD:** Uses real objects when practical, state verification
- **Mockist TDD:** Always mocks interesting behavior, behavior verification

**Relevant Guidelines:**
- TEST-MOCK-VS-STUB - Complete taxonomy with 4 strategies (mock, stub, fake, real)
- TEST-FAKE - Building effective fakes
- TEST-SPY - Using test spies
- TEST-NO-MOCK - When to avoid mocking

**Key Quote:**
> "The vocabulary of testing is getting blurred - to many people, all test doubles are "mocks". Understanding the differences is crucial."

### 3. James Cooke - AAA Pattern for Python
- **URL:** https://jamescooke.info/arrange-act-assert-pattern-for-python-developers.html
- **Author:** James Cooke
- **Used for:** AAA pattern structure, Python-specific implementation
- **Additional Resource:** flake8-aaa plugin for enforcing AAA

**The Three Sections:**

**1. Arrange:**
- Single contiguous block without empty lines
- Avoid assertions during arrangement
- Extract to fixture if complex

**2. Act:**
- Single line starting with `result =`
- Even when no return value, capture it
- Separate with blank lines above and below

**3. Assert:**
- One contiguous block of assertions
- Test returned value first, then side effects
- Extract repeated patterns to helper functions

**Relevant Guidelines:**
- TEST-AAA - Complete AAA pattern with 3 strategies
- TEST-ONE-ASSERT - One behavior per test (related to AAA structure)
- TEST-STRUCTURE - Test organization principles

**Benefits:**
- Clarity through visual structure
- Consistency across test suite
- Maintainability through separation of concerns

**Tool:** flake8-aaa plugin enforces AAA pattern compliance

## Guideline Structure

Each guideline follows this format:

### Code to Test
Shows the production code FIRST, so readers understand what's being tested.

### Multiple Strategies (2-4 per guideline)
Each strategy includes:
- **Complete, runnable test code**
- **Pros** - Benefits of this approach
- **Cons** - Drawbacks and limitations
- **When to use** - Specific scenarios

### Trade-offs
Explicit comparison of when to use each strategy.

### Recommendation
Best practice guidance based on authoritative sources.

---

## Key Differentiators from Other Testing Guides

### 1. Multiple Strategies vs Single "Right" Way
Most testing guides show one approach. This skill shows 2-4 alternatives with trade-offs.

**Example:**
- TEST-PURE-FUNC shows 4 strategies: simple tests, parametrize, property-based, combination
- Each with complete code, pros/cons, and recommendations

### 2. Complete, Runnable Examples
Every example shows:
- Production code being tested
- Complete test code (not snippets)
- Full imports and setup
- Actual assertions

### 3. Trade-Off Analysis
Explicitly discusses:
- Speed vs thoroughness
- Simplicity vs coverage
- Coupling vs isolation
- Maintainability vs flexibility

### 4. Quality Over Quantity
25 guidelines instead of 50+, but each is MUCH more detailed:
- 4 strategies per guideline
- Complete examples for each
- Detailed trade-off analysis
- Clear recommendations

---

## Mnemonic ID Convention

All guidelines use the **TEST-** prefix to identify testing patterns:
- Format: `TEST-KEYWORD`
- Examples: `TEST-AAA`, `TEST-MOCK-VS-STUB`, `TEST-PARAMETRIZE`
- Consistent with project's mnemonic ID pattern (all caps, hyphenated)
- Searchable and distinct from other reviewer skills

## Code Example Attribution

All code examples were:
1. **Inspired by** authoritative sources listed above
2. **Adapted for Python/pytest** - Made Pythonic and pytest-specific
3. **Created as original examples** - Demonstrating specific testing strategies
4. **Structured for education** - Production code → Multiple test strategies → Trade-offs

### Example Pattern:
- **Production Code:** Original, demonstrating testing challenge
- **Test Strategies:** Inspired by pytest docs, Martin Fowler principles, community patterns
- **Trade-offs:** Based on real-world testing experience and authoritative guidance
