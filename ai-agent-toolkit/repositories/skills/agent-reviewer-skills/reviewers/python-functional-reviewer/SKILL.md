````markdown
## Review: data_processor.py

### ✅ Strengths
- **GEN-EXPR**: Good use of generator expression (line 15) for memory efficiency
- **USE-ENUMERATE**: Proper use of enumerate() for indexed iteration

### ⚠️ Suggestions

#### PURE-FUNC: Function relies on external state

**Current code:**
```python
total = 0
def add_to_total(value):
    global total
    total += value
    return total
```

**Suggested refactoring:**
```python
def add_to_total(current_total, value):
    return current_total + value

# Caller maintains state
total = 0
total = add_to_total(total, 5)
```

**Why this matters:**
Pure functions are easier to test, debug, and reason about. They always return the same output for the same input, eliminating unpredictability.

**FP principle:**
"The same input will always return the same output" - pure functions eliminate side effects and global state dependencies.

---

#### PREFER-COMPREHENSION: Using map/filter instead of comprehensions

**Current code:**
```python
results = map(lambda x: x * 2, filter(lambda x: x > 0, numbers))
```

**Suggested refactoring:**
```python
results = [x * 2 for x in numbers if x > 0]
```

**Why this matters:**
List comprehensions are more Pythonic, often more readable, and clearly express intent without lambda functions. The Python community prefers comprehensions for clarity.

**FP principle:**
Combine functional with imperative approaches as needed—Python is multi-paradigm.

# Functional Programming Guidelines

**40+ principles from Python documentation and educational resources**

---

## Pure Functions and Side Effects

### PURE-FUNC: Pure Functions Return Same Output for Same Input

**Source:** Stack Builders - Functional Programming in Python

**Principle:** Pure functions consistently return the same output for identical inputs without side effects, making them predictable and reliable.

**Good Example (Pure Function):**
```python
def powerOfTwo(x):
    return x**2  # powerOfTwo(4) always returns 16
```

**Bad Example (Impure Function):**
```python
y = 3
def powerOfTwo():
    return y**2  # Result changes when y changes
```

**Why this matters:**
"The same input will always return the same output" in pure functions, eliminating unpredictability. Pure functions are easier to test, debug, and reason about.

---

### NO-MODIFY-INPUT: Don't Modify Input Data

**Source:** Stack Abuse - Functional Programming in Python

**Principle:** Pure functions avoid side effects and don't modify external state. Do not change the value of the input or any data that exists outside the function's scope.

**Good Example:**
```python
def multiply_2_pure(numbers):
    new_numbers = []
    for n in numbers:
        new_numbers.append(n * 2)
    return new_numbers

original_numbers = [1, 3, 5, 10]
changed_numbers = multiply_2_pure(original_numbers)
print(original_numbers)  # [1, 3, 5, 10] - unchanged
```

**Why this matters:**
Creating new data structures instead of modifying inputs makes functions safer to use, easier to test, and prevents unexpected behavior in calling code.

---

## Immutability and State

### USE-IMMUTABLE: Prefer Immutable Data Types

**Source:** ArjanCodes - Functional Programming Principles

**Principle:** Creating new objects instead of modifying existing ones reduces state-related bugs.

**Good Example:**
```python
# Immutable approach
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
new_tuple = my_tuple + (4,)
```

**Notes:** Immutable types in Python include int, float, bool, string, tuple, and range.

---

### AVOID-MUTABLE-REF: Beware of Mutable References

**Source:** Stack Builders - Functional Programming in Python

**Principle:** Mutable types share memory references, leading to unexpected modifications.

**Bad Example:**
```python
list1 = [1,2,3]
list2 = list1
list2[1] = 5  # list1 becomes [1,5,3] - unexpected!
```

**Good Example:**
```python
text = "Hello"
text2 = text
text2 = text2 + " World"  # text remains "Hello"
```

**Why this matters:**
Understanding the difference between mutable and immutable types prevents bugs where modifications affect multiple parts of your code unexpectedly.

---

### TUPLE-SAFETY: Use Tuples to Prevent Modification

**Source:** Stack Abuse - Functional Programming in Python

**Principle:** Python offers immutable types like tuples to prevent unintended modifications.

**Example:**
```python
immutable_collection = ('Tim', 10, [4, 5])
immutable_collection[1] = 15  # TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```

**Note:** Mutable objects within tuples can still be modified internally, but the reference itself cannot change.

---

## Higher-Order Functions

### HOF-PATTERN: Functions as First-Class Citizens

**Source:** Stack Builders - Functional Programming in Python

**Principle:** Higher-order functions accept other functions as arguments or return functions.

**Example:**
```python
def sumFive(x):
    return x + 5

def doTwice(func, *val):
    return func(func(*val))

doTwice(sumFive, 5)  # Returns 15
```

**Source 2:** Stack Abuse - Functional Programming in Python

**Example:**
```python
def hof_add(increment):
    def add_increment(numbers):
        new_numbers = []
        for n in numbers:
            new_numbers.append(n + increment)
        return new_numbers
    return add_increment

add5 = hof_add(5)
print(add5([23, 88]))  # [28, 93]
```

**Why this matters:**
Higher-order functions enable flexible abstractions and code reuse by treating functions as data.

---

### LAMBDA-SIMPLE: Use Lambda for Simple Functions

**Source:** Stack Abuse - Functional Programming in Python

**Principle:** Lambda expressions simplify higher-order function usage for simple operations.

**Example:**
```python
def hof_product(multiplier):
    return lambda x: x * multiplier

mult6 = hof_product(6)
print(mult6(6))  # 36
```

---

### AVOID-LAMBDA-COMPLEX: Avoid Complex Lambda Expressions

**Source:** Python Functional Programming HOWTO

**Principle:** Complex logic becomes unreadable in lambda. Fredrik Lundh's refactoring rules suggest: write lambda, add clarifying comment, name the essence, convert to `def`, remove comment.

**Bad Example:**
```python
total = functools.reduce(lambda a, b: (0, a[1] + b[1]), items)[1]
```

**Good Example:**
```python
total = sum(b for a, b in items)
```

**Why this matters:**
Lambda should be used for simple, single-expression functions. Complex logic deserves a proper function definition with a meaningful name.

---

## Lazy Evaluation

### GEN-LAZY: Use Generators for Lazy Evaluation

**Source:** ArjanCodes - Functional Programming Principles

**Principle:** Generators perform operations on-demand, conserving memory versus eager evaluation.

**Bad Example (Eager):**
```python
# Eager evaluation - creates entire list in memory
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
```

**Good Example (Lazy):**
```python
# Lazy evaluation - computes on demand
lazy_squares = (x**2 for x in range(10))
```

**Why this matters:**
Lazy evaluation with generators saves memory and enables working with infinite sequences or large datasets efficiently.

---

### YIELD-GENERATOR: Use yield for Generator Functions

**Source:** Python Functional Programming HOWTO

**Principle:** Functions containing `yield` are generators. They return an iterator producing a stream of values, maintaining state between calls.

**Example:**
```python
def generate_ints(N):
    for i in range(N):
        yield i

gen = generate_ints(3)
next(gen)  # Returns 0
```

**Why this matters:**
Generators maintain state between calls and enable memory-efficient iteration over large or infinite sequences.

---

### GEN-SEND: Use send() to Pass Values Into Generators

**Source:** Python Functional Programming HOWTO

**Principle:** Python 2.5+ allows sending values back into generators using `send()`.

**Example:**
```python
def counter(maximum):
    i = 0
    while i < maximum:
        val = (yield i)
        if val is not None:
            i = val
        else:
            i += 1

it = counter(10)
next(it)      # 0
it.send(8)    # 8
```

**Why this matters:**
The `send()` method enables two-way communication with generators, useful for coroutines and stateful iteration.

---

## Built-in Functional Tools

### USE-MAP: Use map() to Apply Functions to Iterables

**Source:** Python Functional Programming HOWTO

**Principle:** Map applies a function to iterator elements.

**Example:**
```python
def upper(s):
    return s.upper()

list(map(upper, ['sentence', 'fragment']))
# ['SENTENCE', 'FRAGMENT']
```

**Source 2:** Stack Abuse - Functional Programming in Python

**Example:**
```python
names = ['Shivani', 'Jason', 'Yusef', 'Sakura']
greeted_names = map(lambda x: 'Hi ' + x, names)
```

---

### USE-FILTER: Use filter() to Select Elements

**Source:** Python Functional Programming HOWTO

**Principle:** Filter selects elements meeting a condition.

**Example:**
```python
def is_even(x):
    return (x % 2) == 0

list(filter(is_even, range(10)))
# [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
```

**Source 2:** Stack Abuse - Functional Programming in Python

**Example:**
```python
numbers = [13, 4, 18, 35]
div_by_5 = filter(lambda num: num % 5 == 0, numbers)
print(list(div_by_5))  # [35]
```

---

### COMBINE-MAP-FILTER: Combine map and filter for Pipelines

**Source:** Stack Abuse - Functional Programming in Python

**Principle:** Map and filter can be chained to create data processing pipelines.

**Example:**
```python
arbitrary_numbers = map(lambda num: num ** 3,
                       filter(lambda num: num % 3 == 0, range(1, 21)))
print(list(arbitrary_numbers))  # [27, 216, 729, 1728, 3375, 5832]
```

---

### USE-ENUMERATE: Use enumerate() for Indexed Iteration

**Source:** Python Functional Programming HOWTO

**Principle:** enumerate() counts elements with indexes.

**Example:**
```python
for item in enumerate(['subject', 'verb', 'object']):
    print(item)
# (0, 'subject'), (1, 'verb'), (2, 'object')
```

---

### USE-ZIP: Use zip() to Combine Iterables

**Source:** Python Functional Programming HOWTO

**Principle:** zip() combines elements from multiple iterables.

**Example:**
```python
zip(['a', 'b', 'c'], (1, 2, 3))
# ('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)
```

---

### USE-ANY-ALL: Use any() and all() for Boolean Tests

**Source:** Python Functional Programming HOWTO

**Principle:** any() returns True if any element is truthy; all() returns True if all elements are truthy.

**Example:**
```python
any([0, 1, 0])     # True
all([1, 1, 1])     # True
```

---

### USE-SORTED: Use sorted() to Sort Iterables

**Source:** Python Functional Programming HOWTO

**Principle:** sorted() collects and sorts iterator elements.

**Example:**
```python
sorted([3, 1, 4, 1, 5], reverse=True)
# [5, 4, 3, 1, 1]
```

---

## functools Module

### USE-PARTIAL: Use functools.partial() for Specialized Functions

**Source:** Python Functional Programming HOWTO

**Principle:** partial() creates new callables by "freezing" some arguments. Useful for creating specialized versions of functions.

**Example:**
```python
import functools

def log(message, subsystem):
    print('%s: %s' % (subsystem, message))

server_log = functools.partial(log, subsystem='server')
server_log('Unable to open socket')
```

**Source 2:** functools documentation

**Example:**
```python
from functools import partial
basetwo = partial(int, base=2)
basetwo('10010')  # Returns 18
```

---

### USE-REDUCE: Use functools.reduce() for Cumulative Operations

**Source:** Python Functional Programming HOWTO

**Principle:** reduce() cumulatively applies a function to iterator elements.

**Example:**
```python
import functools, operator
functools.reduce(operator.concat, ['A', 'BB', 'C'])
# 'ABBC'

functools.reduce(operator.mul, [1, 2, 3], 1)
# 6
```

**Source 2:** functools documentation

**Example:**
```python
reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  # Returns 15
```

**Why this matters:**
reduce() is powerful for aggregation operations but should be used judiciously - often a for loop or sum() is clearer.

---

### USE-LRU-CACHE: Use @lru_cache for Memoization

**Source:** functools documentation

**Principle:** A memoizing decorator that "saves up to the maxsize most recent calls." Ideal for expensive or I/O-bound functions.

**Example:**
```python
@lru_cache(maxsize=32)
def get_pep(num):
    # fetch and return PEP content
```

**Why this matters:**
Caching expensive function results dramatically improves performance for functions called repeatedly with the same arguments.

---

## itertools Module

### ITER-COUNT: Use itertools.count() for Infinite Sequences

**Source:** Python Functional Programming HOWTO

**Principle:** count() creates infinite sequences with optional start and step.

**Example:**
```python
itertools.count(10, 5)  # 10, 15, 20, 25...
```

---

### ITER-CYCLE: Use itertools.cycle() for Repeating Sequences

**Source:** Python Functional Programming HOWTO

**Principle:** cycle() repeats elements infinitely.

**Example:**
```python
itertools.cycle([1, 2, 3])  # 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3...
```

---

### ITER-CHAIN: Use itertools.chain() to Concatenate Iterables

**Source:** Python Functional Programming HOWTO

**Principle:** chain() concatenates multiple iterables.

**Example:**
```python
itertools.chain(['a', 'b'], (1, 2))
# a, b, 1, 2
```

---

### ITER-ISLICE: Use itertools.islice() for Iterator Slicing

**Source:** Python Functional Programming HOWTO

**Principle:** islice() slices iterators without creating intermediate lists.

**Example:**
```python
itertools.islice(range(10), 2, 8, 2)  # 2, 4, 6
```

---

### ITER-COMBINATIONS: Use itertools.combinations() for Combinations

**Source:** Python Functional Programming HOWTO

**Principle:** combinations() generates all r-length combinations.

**Example:**
```python
itertools.combinations([1, 2, 3], 2)
# (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)
```

---

### ITER-PERMUTATIONS: Use itertools.permutations() for Permutations

**Source:** Python Functional Programming HOWTO

**Principle:** permutations() generates all r-length arrangements.

**Example:**
```python
itertools.permutations([1, 2, 3], 2)
# (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2)
```

---

### ITER-GROUPBY: Use itertools.groupby() for Grouping

**Source:** Python Functional Programming HOWTO

**Principle:** groupby() groups consecutive elements by key.

**Example:**
```python
itertools.groupby(city_list, lambda x: x[1])
# Returns (state_code, iterator) pairs
```

---

### ITER-ACCUMULATE: Use itertools.accumulate() for Running Totals

**Source:** Python Functional Programming HOWTO

**Principle:** accumulate() is similar to reduce but yields intermediate results.

**Example:**
```python
itertools.accumulate([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
# 1, 3, 6, 10, 15
```

---

## Comprehensions and Pythonic Style

### PREFER-COMPREHENSION: Prefer List Comprehensions over map/filter

**Source:** Stack Abuse - Functional Programming in Python

**Principle:** The Python developer community prefers list comprehensions over map/filter for clarity.

**Instead of map/filter:**
```python
greeted_names = map(lambda x: 'Hi ' + x, names)
div_by_5 = filter(lambda num: num % 5 == 0, numbers)
arbitrary_numbers = map(lambda num: num ** 3,
                       filter(lambda num: num % 3 == 0, range(1, 21)))
```

**Prefer comprehensions:**
```python
greeted_names = ['Hi ' + name for name in names]
div_by_5 = [num for num in numbers if num % 5 == 0]
arbitrary_numbers = [num ** 3 for num in range(1, 21) if num % 3 == 0]
```

**Why this matters:**
List comprehensions are more Pythonic, often more readable, and clearly express intent without lambda functions.

---

### GEN-EXPR: Use Generator Expressions for Memory Efficiency

**Source:** Python Functional Programming HOWTO

**Principle:** Generator expressions return iterators instead of lists, saving memory.

**Generator Expression (returns iterator):**
```python
stripped_iter = (line.strip() for line in line_list)
```

**List Comprehension (returns list):**
```python
stripped_list = [line.strip() for line in line_list]
```

**With Conditions:**
```python
stripped_list = [line.strip() for line in line_list if line != ""]
```

**Nested Structure:**
```python
[(x, y) for x in seq1 for y in seq2]
```

---

## Monads and Advanced Patterns

### FUNCTOR-PATTERN: Use Functors for Value Transformation

**Source:** ArjanCodes - Python Functors and Monads

**Principle:** An endofunctor containerizes a value and allows a series of transformations while maintaining the same type.

**Example:**
```python
class Functor(Generic[T]):
    def __init__(self, value: T):
        self.value = value

    def map(self, f: Callable[[T], U]) -> "Functor[U]":
        return Functor(f(self.value))

def add_1(x: int) -> int:
    return x + 1

def square(x: int) -> int:
    return x * x

print(Functor(1).map(add_1).map(square).value)  # 4
```

---

### MAYBE-MONAD: Use Maybe Monad for Null Safety

**Source:** ArjanCodes - Python Functors and Monads

**Principle:** Maybe monad handles optional/null values gracefully without explicit None checks.

**Example:**
```python
class Maybe(Generic[T]):
    def __init__(self, value: T | None):
        self.value = value

    def map(self, f: Callable[[T], U]) -> "Maybe[U]":
        if self.value is None:
            return self
        return Maybe(f(self.value))

def safe_div(x: float, y: float) -> Union[float, None]:
    if y == 0:
        return None
    return x / y

def sub_one(x: float) -> float:
    return x - 1

def add_one(x: float) -> float:
    return x + 1

print(Maybe(1).map(sub_one).map(safe_div).map(add_one).value)  # None
```

**Why this matters:**
The Maybe monad enables function chaining using a "railroad approach," where None values automatically short-circuit the pipeline.

---

### RESULT-MONAD: Use Result Monad for Error Handling

**Source:** ArjanCodes - Python Functors and Monads

**Principle:** Result monad provides explicit error handling with exception context.

**Example:**
```python
class Result(Generic[T]):
    def __init__(self, value: T | Exception):
        self.value = value

    def map(self, f: Callable[[T], U]) -> "Result[U | Exception]":
        if isinstance(self.value, Exception):
            return self
        try:
            return Result(f(self.value))
        except Exception as e:
            return Result(e)
```

**Why this matters:**
The Result monad enhances error management by providing detailed insights into why operations failed, making error handling more composable.

---

## Best Practices

### RECURSION-SIMPLE: Use Recursion for Clear Solutions

**Source:** ArjanCodes - Functional Programming Principles

**Principle:** Functions calling themselves provide clear solutions to complex problems.

**Example:**
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

**Why this matters:**
Recursion can express algorithms more clearly than iterative approaches, especially for tree traversal and divide-and-conquer problems.

---

### USE-NAMEDTUPLE: Use namedtuples for Functional Data Structures

**Source:** ArjanCodes - Functional Programming Principles

**Principle:** Tuples and namedtuples are more predictable than mutable types.

**Example:**
```python
from collections import namedtuple

Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
p = Point(1, 2)
```

**Why this matters:**
Named tuples provide immutability with clear field names, making data structures more self-documenting and safer.

---

### FUNC-COMPOSE: Compose Functions for Complex Operations

**Source:** Python Functional Programming HOWTO

**Principle:** Breaking problems into small functions creates better modularity and testability. Testing is easier because each function is a potential subject for a unit test.

**Design Principle:**
"Break problems into small, focused functions. This makes code easier to understand and maintain."

---

### MULTI-PARADIGM: Combine Functional with Imperative

**Source:** Python Functional Programming HOWTO

**Principle:** Python is multi-paradigm. Combine functional with imperative approaches as needed—don't force pure functional style.

**Philosophy:**
"Python is a **multi-paradigm language** supporting procedural, declarative, object-oriented, and functional approaches. Functional programming decomposes problems into functions that ideally accept inputs and produce outputs without internal state modifications."

### ITERATOR-PROTOCOL: Understand Iterator Limitations

**Source:** Python Functional Programming HOWTO

**Principle:** Iterators can only move forward; there's no backward navigation, reset capability, or copying without recreating the iterator.

**Key Point:**
"You can only move forward; there's no backward navigation, reset capability, or copying without recreating the iterator."

## Async Functional Patterns

### ASYNC-GEN: Async Generators for Streaming

```python
async def stream_events(source):
    async for page in source:
        for event in page.events:
            yield event
```

- Process unbounded feeds without buffering everything in memory.

### ASYNC-PIPE: Compose Async Pipelines

```python
async def pipeline(value, *steps):
    result = value
    for step in steps:
        result = await step(result)
    return result
```

- Keeps asynchronous transformations declarative.

### ASYNC-CANCEL: Propagate Cancellation

```python
async def fetch_with_timeout(coro, timeout=5):
    return await asyncio.wait_for(coro, timeout)
```

- Ensures cooperative cancellation for long-running chains.

## Typing-Friendly FP

### TYPE-READONLY: Use Immutable Types

```python
from typing import NamedTuple

class Product(NamedTuple):
    id: int
    price: float
    tags: tuple[str, ...]
```

### PROTOCOL-FP: Protocols for Behavior

```python
class Serializer(Protocol):
    def dumps(self, data: Mapping[str, Any]) -> str: ...
```

- Allows passing different implementations into FP pipelines without concrete inheritance.

### GENERIC-FP: Preserve Type Information

```python
T = TypeVar('T')

def tap(fn: Callable[[T], None]) -> Callable[[T], T]:
    def wrapper(value: T) -> T:
        fn(value)
        return value
    return wrapper
```

## Expected Good Patterns (Check for Absence)

> **Sources:** [Python Functional Programming HOWTO](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html), [Real Python FP Guide](https://realpython.com/python-functional-programming/), [itertools docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html), [functools docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html)

This section identifies the **absence of good patterns** (not just presence of anti-patterns). Use `MISSING-*` IDs for tracking.

### 1. Pure Function Patterns

**Mnemonic:** **"PURE-FUNCTIONS-FIRST"**

| Expected Pattern | If Missing |
|------------------|------------|
| Functions with no side effects | 🔴 `MISSING-PURE-FUNC` - Hidden state changes |
| Same input → same output | 🔴 `MISSING-DETERMINISTIC` - Unpredictable behavior |
| No modification of input data | ⚠️ `MISSING-IMMUTABLE-INPUT` - Caller data corrupted |
| Return values instead of mutations | ⚠️ `MISSING-RETURN-VALUE` - Side-effect programming |

```python
# PRESENT: Pure function patterns
from copy import deepcopy


def add_tax(price: float, tax_rate: float = 0.1) -> float:
    """Pure: same input always gives same output."""
    return price * (1 + tax_rate)


def filter_adults(users: list[dict]) -> list[dict]:
    """Pure: doesn't modify input, returns new list."""
    return [user for user in users if user['age'] >= 18]


def update_user_status(user: dict, new_status: str) -> dict:
    """Pure: returns new dict, doesn't modify original."""
    return {**user, 'status': new_status}


def process_items(items: list[str]) -> list[str]:
    """Pure: creates new list, original unchanged."""
    return [item.upper().strip() for item in items]


# MISSING: Impure functions
total = 0  # Module-level state!

def add_to_total(amount: float) -> float:
    global total  # Mutation of global state!
    total += amount
    return total


def sort_users(users: list[dict]) -> list[dict]:
    users.sort(key=lambda u: u['name'])  # MUTATES input!
    return users  # Caller's list is now sorted


def get_timestamp() -> float:
    return time.time()  # Non-deterministic! Different each call
```

### 2. Generator & Lazy Evaluation Patterns

**Mnemonic:** **"YIELD-DONT-RETURN"**

| Expected Pattern | If Missing |
|------------------|------------|
| Generator functions for large data | 🔴 `MISSING-GENERATOR` - Memory exhaustion |
| Generator expressions over list comprehensions | ⚠️ `MISSING-GENEXPR` - Unnecessary memory |
| `yield from` for nested generators | 💡 `MISSING-YIELD-FROM` - Verbose delegation |
| `itertools.islice()` for partial iteration | 💡 `MISSING-ISLICE` - Loading full iterator |

```python
# PRESENT: Lazy evaluation with generators
from itertools import islice


def read_large_file(path: str):
    """Generator: processes one line at a time, never loads entire file."""
    with open(path) as f:
        for line in f:
            yield line.strip()


def transform_data(items):
    """Generator: transforms lazily, on demand."""
    for item in items:
        yield expensive_transform(item)


# Generator expression instead of list comprehension
large_data = range(10_000_000)
squares = (x ** 2 for x in large_data)  # Generator: no memory until consumed
first_10 = list(islice(squares, 10))  # Only compute what we need


def flatten(nested):
    """yield from for clean nested iteration."""
    for item in nested:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            yield from flatten(item)  # Delegate to sub-generator
        else:
            yield item


# MISSING: Eager evaluation (anti-pattern for large data)
def read_large_file_bad(path: str) -> list[str]:
    """Loads ENTIRE file into memory at once!"""
    with open(path) as f:
        return [line.strip() for line in f]  # Could be GBs!


def transform_data_bad(items):
    """Transforms ALL items before returning anything."""
    result = []
    for item in items:
        result.append(expensive_transform(item))  # All in memory!
    return result


# List comprehension for large data (bad!)
squares_bad = [x ** 2 for x in range(10_000_000)]  # 400MB+ in memory!
```

### 3. Higher-Order Function Patterns

**Mnemonic:** **"FUNCTIONS-AS-DATA"**

| Expected Pattern | If Missing |
|------------------|------------|
| Functions passed as arguments | ⚠️ `MISSING-HOF` - Hardcoded behavior |
| `functools.partial` for specialization | 💡 `MISSING-PARTIAL` - Verbose wrappers |
| Function composition | 💡 `MISSING-COMPOSE` - Long procedural chains |
| `@functools.wraps` on decorators | ⚠️ `MISSING-WRAPS` - Lost function metadata |

```python
# PRESENT: Higher-order function patterns
from functools import partial, wraps, reduce
from typing import Callable, TypeVar

T = TypeVar('T')
R = TypeVar('R')


def apply_to_all(func: Callable[[T], R], items: list[T]) -> list[R]:
    """HOF: accepts function as argument."""
    return [func(item) for item in items]


# functools.partial for specialization
def power(base: int, exponent: int) -> int:
    return base ** exponent

square = partial(power, exponent=2)  # Specialized version
cube = partial(power, exponent=3)

squares = list(map(square, [1, 2, 3, 4]))  # [1, 4, 9, 16]


# Function composition
def compose(*funcs: Callable) -> Callable:
    """Compose multiple functions right-to-left."""
    def composed(x):
        for func in reversed(funcs):
            x = func(x)
        return x
    return composed

clean_and_upper = compose(str.upper, str.strip, str.lower)
result = clean_and_upper("  HeLLo  ")  # "HELLO"


# Decorator with @wraps
def log_calls(func: Callable) -> Callable:
    @wraps(func)  # Preserves __name__, __doc__, etc.
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        print(f"Calling {func.__name__}")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper


# MISSING: Hardcoded behavior instead of HOF
def process_items_hardcoded(items):
    """Hardcoded transformation - can't reuse with different logic."""
    return [item.upper() for item in items]  # Always upper!


# MISSING: Decorator without @wraps
def log_calls_bad(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):  # No @wraps!
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@log_calls_bad
def my_func():
    """Important docstring."""
    pass

print(my_func.__name__)  # "wrapper" - metadata lost!
print(my_func.__doc__)   # None - docstring lost!
```

### 4. Comprehension Patterns (Pythonic FP)

**Mnemonic:** **"COMPREHENSIONS-OVER-MAP"**

| Expected Pattern | If Missing |
|------------------|------------|
| List comprehension over `map()`+`list()` | 💡 `MISSING-LIST-COMP` - Less Pythonic |
| Dict comprehension for transformations | 💡 `MISSING-DICT-COMP` - Verbose dict building |
| Set comprehension for unique values | 💡 `MISSING-SET-COMP` - Extra set() call |
| Conditional expressions in comprehensions | 💡 `MISSING-COMP-FILTER` - Separate filter step |

```python
# PRESENT: Pythonic comprehensions (preferred in Python)

# List comprehension (more Pythonic than map)
squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(10)]
# vs: list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, range(10)))

# With filtering (comprehension > map+filter)
even_squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
# vs: list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, map(lambda x: x ** 2, range(10))))

# Dict comprehension
users_by_id = {user['id']: user for user in users}

# Set comprehension
unique_emails = {user['email'].lower() for user in users}

# Nested comprehension (matrix flatten)
matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
flat = [num for row in matrix for num in row]  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]


# MISSING: Using map/filter when comprehension clearer
# Less Pythonic
squares_map = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, range(10)))

# Especially confusing with nested map/filter
result = list(filter(
    lambda x: x > 10,
    map(lambda x: x ** 2, range(10))
))

# When to USE map/filter: pre-existing named function
names = list(map(str.upper, raw_names))  # OK: str.upper exists
lengths = list(map(len, strings))  # OK: len exists
```

### 5. itertools Patterns

**Mnemonic:** **"ITERTOOLS-FOR-EFFICIENCY"**

| Expected Pattern | If Missing |
|------------------|------------|
| `chain()` for concatenating iterables | 💡 `MISSING-CHAIN` - Multiple loops |
| `groupby()` for grouped processing | 💡 `MISSING-GROUPBY` - Manual grouping logic |
| `accumulate()` for running totals | 💡 `MISSING-ACCUMULATE` - Manual accumulation |
| `combinations/permutations` | 💡 `MISSING-COMBINATORICS` - Manual nested loops |

```python
# PRESENT: itertools for clean, efficient iteration
from itertools import chain, groupby, accumulate, combinations, takewhile, dropwhile


# chain() - combine multiple iterables
all_items = chain(list1, list2, list3)  # Single lazy iterator
for item in all_items:
    process(item)


# groupby() - group consecutive elements
from operator import itemgetter

data = [
    {'dept': 'sales', 'name': 'Alice'},
    {'dept': 'sales', 'name': 'Bob'},
    {'dept': 'eng', 'name': 'Carol'},
]
# Must be sorted by key first!
sorted_data = sorted(data, key=itemgetter('dept'))
for dept, group in groupby(sorted_data, key=itemgetter('dept')):
    print(f"{dept}: {[p['name'] for p in group]}")


# accumulate() - running totals
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
running_sum = list(accumulate(numbers))  # [1, 3, 6, 10, 15]


# combinations() - all k-combinations
items = ['A', 'B', 'C']
pairs = list(combinations(items, 2))  # [('A','B'), ('A','C'), ('B','C')]


# takewhile/dropwhile - conditional slicing
numbers = [2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10]
evens = list(takewhile(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))  # [2, 4, 6]


# MISSING: Manual implementations instead of itertools
# Don't do this:
def chain_manual(*iterables):
    for it in iterables:
        for item in it:
            yield item

# Don't do this:
running_total = 0
running_sums = []
for num in numbers:
    running_total += num
    running_sums.append(running_total)
```

### 6. functools Patterns

**Mnemonic:** **"FUNCTOOLS-FOR-FUNCTIONS"**

| Expected Pattern | If Missing |
|------------------|------------|
| `@lru_cache` for memoization | 🔴 `MISSING-MEMOIZATION` - Redundant computation |
| `reduce()` for cumulative operations | 💡 `MISSING-REDUCE` - Verbose loops |
| `@singledispatch` for type-based dispatch | 💡 `MISSING-DISPATCH` - Manual type checking |
| `@cache` for simple memoization (3.9+) | 💡 `MISSING-CACHE-DECORATOR` - Manual caching |

```python
# PRESENT: functools for function manipulation
from functools import lru_cache, reduce, singledispatch, cache


# @lru_cache for expensive computations
@lru_cache(maxsize=128)
def fibonacci(n: int) -> int:
    """Memoized: O(n) instead of O(2^n)."""
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)


# @cache (Python 3.9+) - simpler unbounded cache
@cache
def expensive_computation(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    return x ** y  # Cached forever


# reduce() for cumulative operations
from operator import mul

product = reduce(mul, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  # 120
# Equivalent to: 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5


# @singledispatch for type-based behavior
@singledispatch
def process(value):
    raise NotImplementedError(f"No handler for {type(value)}")

@process.register(str)
def _(value: str) -> str:
    return value.upper()

@process.register(list)
def _(value: list) -> list:
    return [item.upper() if isinstance(item, str) else item for item in value]


# MISSING: Redundant computation without memoization
def fibonacci_slow(n: int) -> int:
    """No memoization: O(2^n) - exponentially slow!"""
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fibonacci_slow(n - 1) + fibonacci_slow(n - 2)

# fibonacci_slow(40) takes SECONDS
# fibonacci(40) with @lru_cache is instant


# MISSING: Manual loop instead of reduce
product = 1
for num in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
    product *= num  # Verbose!
```
