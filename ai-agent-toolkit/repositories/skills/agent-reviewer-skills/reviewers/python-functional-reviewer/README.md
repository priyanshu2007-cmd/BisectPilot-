# Functional Python Reviewer Skill

A Claude Code skill that reviews Python code using functional programming principles extracted from Python official documentation and educational resources.

## What This Skill Does

This skill transforms Claude into a code reviewer who:
- Applies functional programming principles to Python code
- Provides structured feedback with specific guideline references (mnemonic IDs)
- Explains the "why" behind each suggestion
- Balances functional purity with Pythonic pragmatism

## Installation

Use the [repository-wide installer](../../README.md#installation-and-use) and pass this reviewer directory name to `--skill`.

## How to Use

Simply ask Claude to review your Python code:

```
"Review this code for functional programming patterns"
"Check this function for side effects and purity"
"Suggest functional improvements for this code"
"Can this use generators instead of lists?"
```

The skill will automatically activate based on keywords like:
- functional, FP, pure function, immutability
- generator, map, filter, reduce
- comprehension, functools, itertools

## What You'll Get

A structured review with:
- ✅ **Strengths** - What follows FP principles (with mnemonic IDs)
- ⚠️ **Suggestions** - Issues with guideline IDs (e.g., **PURE-FUNC**, **GEN-LAZY**)
- 💡 **FP Wisdom** - Relevant quotes from sources

### Example Review

````markdown
## Review: data_processor.py

### ✅ Strengths
- **GEN-EXPR**: Excellent use of generator expression (line 15) for memory efficiency
- **USE-ENUMERATE**: Proper use of enumerate() for indexed iteration

### ⚠️ Suggestions

#### PURE-FUNC: Function relies on external state

**Current code:**
```python
total = 0
def add_to_total(value):
    global total
    total += value
    return total
```

**Suggested refactoring:**
```python
def add_to_total(current_total, value):
    return current_total + value

# Caller maintains state
total = 0
total = add_to_total(total, 5)
```

**Why this matters:**
Pure functions are easier to test, debug, and reason about. They always return the same output for the same input, eliminating unpredictability.

**FP principle:**
"The same input will always return the same output" - pure functions eliminate side effects and global state dependencies.

## When to Use This Skill

✅ **Good use cases:**
- Reviewing code for functional patterns
- Refactoring to reduce side effects
- Improving immutability and purity
- Learning functional programming concepts
- Optimizing with generators and itertools
- Team code review standards for FP

❌ **Not ideal for:**
- Non-Python code
- Pure OOP design patterns
- Performance profiling (use specialized tools)
- Security audits (use security-focused tools)

## Core FP Philosophy

The skill emphasizes these recurring themes:

1. **Pure Functions** - Same input → same output, no side effects
2. **Immutability** - Data doesn't change once created
3. **Higher-Order Functions** - Functions as first-class objects
4. **Lazy Evaluation** - Generators for memory efficiency
5. **Composition** - Building complex operations from simple functions
6. **Pythonic Balance** - Functional when beneficial, not dogmatic
7. **Built-in Tools** - Leverage map, filter, itertools, functools
8. **Comprehensions** - Prefer list comprehensions over map/filter

## Customization

To modify this skill:
1. Edit `SKILL.md` to change Claude's review behavior or update guidelines
2. The skill will automatically reload on next use
3. For reference, see `../docs/functional-python/guidelines.md` for the source guidelines

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Activating

If Claude doesn't use the skill, try:
- Use explicit keywords: "review using functional programming principles"
- Mention specific concepts: "check for pure functions and immutability"
- Check that SKILL.md exists in the correct directory
- Verify YAML frontmatter is valid (no tabs)

### Want More Detail

Ask for deeper analysis:
```
"Review this thoroughly for all functional programming patterns"
"What functional improvements can be made to this code?"
"Check this against all FP guidelines"
```
