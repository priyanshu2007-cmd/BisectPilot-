# Rhodes Python Code Reviewer Skill

A coding-agent skill that reviews Python code using [Brandon Rhodes](https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/)' 70 coding principles extracted from 15+ years of conference presentations (2010-2024) and his Python Patterns Guide.

## A Note from [Brandon Rhodes](https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/)

> Hey, folks, this is Brandon Rhodes, making a personal comment on this project, since Sankar was kind enough to ask my permission before making it public! While I myself am dismayed at the broad impact of AI on society so far, and have always been skeptical about automated code review (I've always used 'pyflakes' instead of 'flake8' because flake8's clumsy attempts to apply PEP-8 produce so much noise), I see no reason to stand in the way of this experiment. It tries to distill some of the guidelines that I've offered in my talks into a set of rules that can be applied by machine. I can't guess whether Claude Code will really understand when my ideas are useful and when they're not, but it's interesting to see how many pieces of advice worked their way into my talks over so many years.

## What This Skill Does

This skill transforms Claude into a code reviewer who:
- Applies Brandon Rhodes' Python coding guidelines
- Provides structured feedback with specific guideline references (mnemonic IDs)
- Explains the "why" behind each suggestion
- Channels Rhodes' thoughtful, pedagogical teaching style

## Installation

Use the [repository-wide installer](../../README.md#installation-and-use) and pass this reviewer directory name to `--skill`.

## How to Use

Simply ask Claude to review your Python code:

```
"Review this Python function using Rhodes guidelines"
"Can you check this code against Rhodes principles?"
"What would Brandon Rhodes say about this architecture?"
```

The skill will automatically activate based on keywords like:
- review, code review, Python review
- Rhodes, guidelines, best practices
- feedback, critique

## What You'll Get

A structured review with:
- ✅ **Strengths** - What follows Rhodes' principles (with mnemonic IDs)
- ⚠️ **Suggestions** - Issues with guideline IDs (e.g., **HOIST-IO**, **NO-MOCK**)
- 💡 **Rhodes Wisdom** - Relevant quotes from his talks

### Example Review

`````markdown
## Review: data_processor.py

### ✅ Strengths
- **DICT-COMP**: Excellent use of dictionary comprehension (line 15)
- **PRECISE-NOUN**: Variable names clearly indicate their purpose

### ⚠️ Suggestions

#### HOIST-IO: I/O operations mixed with business logic

**Current code:**
```python
def process_users():
    with open('users.csv') as f:
        data = parse_csv(f)
        return transform_data(data)
```

**Suggested refactoring:**
```python
def process_users(file_content):
    """Process user data from file content."""
    data = parse_csv(file_content)
    return transform_data(data)

# Caller handles I/O at top level
with open('users.csv') as f:
    result = process_users(f.read())
```

**Why this matters:**
Separating I/O from business logic makes `process_users()` testable without
file mocking. You can now test with simple string data in memory.

**Rhodes' principle:**
"Move all I/O operations to the program's top level, allowing core logic
to remain pure and testable."

### 💡 Rhodes Wisdom

## When to Use This Skill

✅ **Good use cases:**
- Reviewing new Python functions or classes
- Architectural design feedback
- Refactoring guidance
- Learning Rhodes' principles through code review
- Team code review standards

❌ **Not ideal for:**
- Non-Python code
- Performance profiling (use specialized tools)
- Security audits (use security-focused tools)
- Auto-fixing code (provides guidance, not automatic fixes)

## Rhodes' Core Philosophy

The skill emphasizes Rhodes' recurring themes:

1. **Separation of Concerns** - Keep I/O separate from business logic
2. **Pure Functions** - Prefer pure functions that are easy to test
3. **Explicit Over Implicit** - Clear naming and explicit operations
4. **Data Over Control Flow** - Show data structures, not flowcharts
5. **Composition Over Inheritance** - Use functions and data structures
6. **Avoid Mocking** - Architecture problems, not testing solutions
7. **Language Features Over Patterns** - Use Python's built-in capabilities
8. **Readable Code** - Self-documenting through good naming and structure
