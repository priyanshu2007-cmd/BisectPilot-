## A Note from [Brandon Rhodes](https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/)

> Hey, folks, this is Brandon Rhodes, making a personal comment on this project, since Sankar was kind enough to ask my permission before making it public! While I myself am dismayed at the broad impact of AI on society so far, and have always been skeptical about automated code review (I've always used 'pyflakes' instead of 'flake8' because flake8's clumsy attempts to apply PEP-8 produce so much noise), I see no reason to stand in the way of this experiment. It tries to distill some of the guidelines that I've offered in my talks into a set of rules that can be applied by machine. I can't guess whether Claude Code will really understand when my ideas are useful and when they're not, but it's interesting to see how many pieces of advice worked their way into my talks over so many years.
