## Legal Disclaimer and Copyright Notice

### What This Skill Uses

This skill uses **established refactoring terminology and code smell names** that originated in Martin Fowler's seminal book "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code" (1999, 2nd edition 2018) and have become **standard industry terminology** in software engineering.

**Specifically:**
