## Concept Sources

### Problem Domain vs. Solution Domain

**Principle:** Requirements describe the problem (what's needed), not the solution (how it's built).

**Sources:**
- **Michael Jackson** - "Problem Frames" (2001)
- **Pamela Zave & Michael Jackson** - "Four Dark Corners of Requirements Engineering" (1997)
- **IEEE 830** - Distinguishing functional requirements from design constraints

**Guidelines Derived:**
- PROB-WHAT: Focus on WHAT, Not HOW
- PROB-NO-ARCH: No Architecture Decisions
- PROB-NO-DESIGN: No Design Details
- PROB-NO-TECH: No Technology Choices
- PROB-EXTERNAL: Focus on External Behavior

---

### Requirements Quality Attributes

**Principle:** Good requirements are clear, complete, consistent, verifiable, traceable, etc.

**Sources:**
- **IEEE 830** - Characteristics of good SRS
- **Karl Wiegers** - Requirements quality attributes
- **ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2011** - Systems and software engineering requirements

**Quality Attributes:**
- **Unambiguous** - Only one interpretation
- **Complete** - All necessary information present
- **Consistent** - No contradictions
- **Verifiable** - Can be tested/verified
- **Traceable** - Linked to source and design
- **Modifiable** - Easy to change
- **Prioritized** - Importance indicated

**Guidelines Derived:**
- REQ-CLEAR: Clear, unambiguous language
- REQ-COMPLETE: Complete information
- CONS-NO-CONFLICT: No contradictions
- REQ-TESTABLE: Verifiable requirements
- REQ-TRACE: Traceability

---

### Avoiding Ambiguity in Requirements

**Principle:** Eliminate words and phrases that have multiple interpretations.

**Sources:**
- **Donald Firesmith** - "Common Requirements Problems" (2007)
- **Karl Wiegers** - Ambiguous terms to avoid
- **NASA** - Requirements writing guidelines

**Common Ambiguous Terms:**
- "Fast", "quick", "rapid" - How fast?
- "User-friendly", "easy to use" - According to whom?
- "Etc.", "and so on" - What else is included?
- "Appropriate", "suitable" - What criteria?
- "Flexible", "adaptable" - In what ways?

**Guidelines Derived:**
- REQ-AVOID-VAGUE: Avoid Vague Terms
- REQ-MEASURABLE: Make Requirements Measurable
- REQ-CLEAR: Unambiguous language

---

### Functional vs. Non-Functional Requirements

**Principle:** Systems have both functional requirements (what they do) and non-functional requirements (how well they do it).

**Sources:**
- **Lawrence Chung et al.** - "Non-Functional Requirements in Software Engineering" (1999)
- **ISO/IEC 25010** - System and software quality models
- **Martin Glinz** - "On Non-Functional Requirements" (2007)

**Non-Functional Categories:**
- Performance (speed, throughput, response time)
- Scalability (growth capacity)
- Security (protection, authentication)
- Reliability (uptime, MTBF)
- Usability (ease of use, learnability)
- Maintainability (modifiability, testability)
- Portability (adaptability, installability)

**Guidelines Derived:**
- COMP-NFR: Include Non-Functional Requirements

---

## Anti-Pattern Sources

**Principle:** Don't add features beyond what's needed or requested.

**Sources:**
- **Steve McConnell** - "Code Complete" (2004) - discusses gold plating in development
- **Project Management Institute** - PMBOK Guide - scope creep and gold plating
- **Agile Manifesto** - Principles of simplicity

**Guidelines Derived:**

- ANTI-FUTURE: Avoid premature future-proofing

---

### Mixing Requirements with Design

**Principle:** Requirements state needs; design specifies solutions. Keep them separate.

**Sources:**
- **IEEE 830** - SRS should not include design
- **Karl Wiegers** - Requirements vs. design
- **Alistair Cockburn** - Use cases describe external behavior

**Guidelines Derived:**
- PROB-NO-DESIGN: No Design Details
- PROB-NO-ARCH: No Architecture Decisions
- PROB-NO-TECH: No Technology Choices
- ANTI-IMPL: Don't Sneak Implementation into Requirements
