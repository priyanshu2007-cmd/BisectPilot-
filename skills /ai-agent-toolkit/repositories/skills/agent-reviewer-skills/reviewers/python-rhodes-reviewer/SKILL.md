## Rhodes' Philosophy

Channel Brandon Rhodes' teaching style:
1. **Pedagogical** - Explain the "why" behind suggestions
2. **Pragmatic** - Focus on real-world impact
3. **Respectful** - Appreciate good code, suggest improvements gently
4. **Principled** - Always tie feedback to core principles

## Example Review

````markdown
## Review: data_processor.py

### ✅ Strengths
- **DICT-COMP**: Excellent use of dictionary comprehension (line 15)
- **PRECISE-NOUN**: Variable names clearly indicate their purpose (`user_records`, `processed_data`)

### ⚠️ Suggestions

#### HOIST-IO: I/O operations mixed with business logic

**Current code:**
```python
def process_users():
    with open('users.csv') as f:
        data = parse_csv(f)
        return transform_data(data)
```

**Suggested refactoring:**
```python
def process_users(file_content):
    """Process user data from file content."""
    data = parse_csv(file_content)
    return transform_data(data)

# Caller handles I/O at top level
with open('users.csv') as f:
    result = process_users(f.read())
```

**Why this matters:**
Separating I/O from business logic makes `process_users()` testable without file mocking. You can now test with simple string data in memory, making tests faster and more reliable.

**Rhodes' principle:**
"Move all I/O operations to the program's top level, allowing core logic to remain pure and testable."

---

#### NO-MOCK: Test uses excessive mocking indicating architectural issues

**Current code:**
```python
@patch('data_processor.open')
def test_process_users(mock_open):
    mock_open.return_value.__enter__.return_value.read.return_value = "data"
    result = process_users()
    assert result == expected
```

**Suggested refactoring:**
```python
def test_process_users():
    # No mocking needed - just pass data directly
    test_data = "user1,John\nuser2,Jane"
    result = process_users(test_data)
    assert result == expected
```

**Why this matters:**
If you need `patch()` to test your code, it signals that I/O is too tightly coupled with logic. The architectural fix (HOIST-IO) eliminates the need for mocking entirely.

**Rhodes' principle:**
"If you consider patch() an anti-pattern in production code—why are you doing it in your tests? Mocking signals architectural problems."

## Common Code Smells to Look For

### I/O Coupling
- File operations inside business logic → **HOIST-IO**
- Database queries in computational functions → **HOIST-IO**

### Testing Issues
- Excessive use of mock.patch() → **NO-MOCK**
- Class-based tests for simple functions → **FUNC-TEST**
- Complex setup/teardown → **PURE-TEST**

### Naming Problems
- Vague variable names (data, result, value) → **PRECISE-NOUN**
- Functions without verbs (database(), connection()) → **USE-VERBS**
- Plural collection names without type info → **AVOID-PLURAL**

### Architecture Red Flags
- import-time side effects → **NO-IMPORT-FX**
- Global mutable state → **NO-GLOBAL-MUT**
- Deep inheritance hierarchies → **COMP-INHERIT**

### API Design Issues

- Expensive properties → **SHOW-COST**
- Functions mutating arguments → **NO-MUTARGS**

## Rhodes' Core Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns** - Keep I/O separate from business logic
2. **Pure Functions** - Prefer pure functions that are easy to test
3. **Explicit Over Implicit** - Clear naming and explicit operations
4. **Data Over Control Flow** - Show data structures, not flowcharts
5. **Composition Over Inheritance** - Use functions and data structures
6. **Avoid Mocking** - Architecture problems, not testing solutions
7. **Language Features Over Patterns** - Use Python's built-in capabilities

## Testing and Test Design

### FUNC-TEST: Function-Based Tests Over Class-Based Tests

**Source:** Forcing unittest to function (2024)

**Principle:** Use function-based tests instead of class-based tests to avoid unnecessary boilerplate and maintain clarity.

**Approach 1: TestCase Class Generation**
```python
def find_tests(module_name):
    module = sys.modules[module_name]
    class Tests(TestCase): pass
    for name in dir(module):
        if name.startswith('test'):
            f = getattr(module, name)
            setattr(Tests, name, staticmethod(f))
    return Tests
```

**Approach 2: load_tests Hook**
```python
def find_tests(package_name):
    module = sys.modules[package_name]
    tests = []
    for name in dir(module):
        if name.startswith('test'):
            f = getattr(module, name)
            tests.append(FunctionTestCase(f))
    return tests
```

**Notes:** Both approaches leverage Python introspection (`dir()` and `getattr()`) to dynamically discover tests without requiring class inheritance.

---

### PURE-TEST: Pure Functions Make Testing Easy

**Source:** The Clean Architecture in Python (2014)

**Principle:** Separate I/O from business logic to create pure functions that are easy to test without mocking.

**Bad Example:**
```python
def find_definition(word):
    q = 'define ' + word
    url = 'http://api.duckduckgo.com/?'
    url += urlencode({'q': q, 'format': 'json'})
    response = requests.get(url)  # I/O embedded
    data = response.json()
    definition = data[u'Definition']
    if definition == u'':
        raise ValueError('that is not a word')
    return definition
```

**Good Example:**
```python
def find_definition(word):
    url = build_url(word)
    data = requests.get(url).json()  # I/O isolated
    return pluck_definition(data)

def build_url(word):
    # Pure function - testable without mocking
    q = 'define ' + word
    url = 'http://api.duckduckgo.com/?'
    url += urlencode({'q': q, 'format': 'json'})
    return url

def pluck_definition(data):
    # Pure function - testable with simple data
    definition = data[u'Definition']
    if definition == u'':
        raise ValueError('that is not a word')
    return definition
```

**Test Example:**
```python
def test_build_url():
    assert build_url('word') == (
        'http://api.duckduckgo.com/?q=define+word&format=json')
```

**Notes:** Pure functions eliminate need for dependency injection and mocking. Tests use only data, creating symmetric test/normal calls.

---

### NO-MOCK: Avoid Mocking in Tests

**Source:** Hoisting Your I/O (2015)

**Principle:** If you consider `patch()` an anti-pattern in production code—why are you doing it in your tests? Mocking signals architectural problems.

**Notes:** Using `mock.patch()` indicates code has coupled I/O that should be separated. Tests should act as a "second caller" from day one to reveal coupling issues.

---

### BREAK-TEST: Intentional Test Breaking for Confidence

**Source:** Walking the Line (2023)

**Principle:** Before major refactors, deliberately break code to verify tests actually catch problems.

**Practice:**
- **"asdf check"** - Add invalid code to verify tests actually run
- Break code deliberately before refactoring to ensure test coverage
- Don't trust extensive refactoring with continuous green - verify tests work

**Quote:** "Performing extensive refactoring with continuous green status can breed doubt. Solution: intentional 'asdf check' - adding invalid code to verify tests actually run."

**Notes:** This addresses the psychological aspect of testing - developers need confidence that their tests actually work, not just pass.

---

### REDUND-OK: Embrace Redundancy Over Elegance

**Source:** Walking the Line (2023)

**Principle:** Engineers must embrace redundancy and robustness over mathematical elegance. Systems should operate well away from failure lines, not right at them.

**Real-World Example:** Georgia Tech HR system failure - 3,000 employees received wrongful termination emails due to incomplete file transfer. Engineers chose minimal `rsync` solution over VP's proposed `--END--` marker validation.

**Lesson:** Systems need defensive redundancy, not minimal code.

**Notes:** This is a critical principle about production systems - simplicity in code doesn't always mean simplicity in error handling.

---

## Architecture and Design Patterns

### HOIST-IO: Hoisting I/O - Keep Side Effects at Top Level

**Source:** Hoisting Your I/O (2015)

**Principle:** Move all I/O operations to the program's top level, allowing core logic to remain pure and testable.

**Bad Example:**
```python
def parse_hosts_file(path):
    hosts = []
    with open(path) as f:
        for line in f:
            line = line.strip()
            if line and not line.startswith('#'):
                hosts.append(line)
    return hosts
```

**Good Example - Return Data Structure:**
```python
def parse_hosts_file(path):
    hosts = []
    with open(path) as f:
        for line in f:
            line = line.strip()
            if line and not line.startswith('#'):
                hosts.append(line)
    return hosts
```

**Good Example - Generator Pattern:**
```python
def parse_hosts(lines):
    for line in lines:
        line = line.strip()
        if not line or line.startswith('#'):
            continue
        yield line
```

**Usage:**
```python
with open('hosts.txt') as f:
    for host in parse_hosts(f):
        print(host)
```

**Notes:** This decouples parsing logic from specific output mechanisms and file handling.

---

### FUNC-SHELL: Functional Core, Imperative Shell

**Source:** The Clean Architecture in Python (2014)

**Principle:** Separate code into a functional core (pure functions) and imperative shell (procedures with I/O).

**Bad Example (Procedural with Side Effects):**
```python
def uppercase_words(wordlist):
    for word in wordlist:
        print word.upper()  # I/O as side effect
```

**Good Example (Functional):**
```python
def process_words(wordlist):
    for word in wordlist:
        yield word.upper()  # Returns data

def procedural_glue(wordlist):
    for word in process_words(wordlist):
        print word  # I/O separated
```

**Notes:** This creates many fast unit tests for the functional core and few integration tests for the imperative shell.

---

### CHAIN-PARAM: Method Chaining Over Parameter Treadmill

**Source:** The History of a Science Hidden in Astronomy Code (2023)

**Principle:** Use method chains for clarity instead of adding optional parameters indefinitely.

**Good Example:**
```python
earth.at(t).observe(mars).apparent().coordinates()
earth.at(t).observe(mars).xyz  # Skip apparent calculations
```

**Notes:** Method chaining avoids the "parameter treadmill" problem where features are added as endless optional parameters.

---

### CONFIG-OBJ: Configuration Objects

**Source:** The History of a Science Hidden in Astronomy Code (2023)

**Principle:** Pass configuration objects explicitly instead of using hard-coded assumptions or global state.

**Good Example:**
```python
wgs72 = Geoid(radius_m=6378135.0, flattening=1/298.26)
wroc = wgs72.latlon(+51.1079, 17.0385)
```

**Notes:** Benefits include no global state, thread-safe operation, explicit choices, and avoiding parameter treadmill.

---

### CONTROL-CALLER: Healthy Boundaries - Return Control to Caller

**Source:** The History of a Science Hidden in Astronomy Code (2023)

**Principle:** Return control to the caller rather than trying to solve all downstream problems.

**Good Example:**
```python
file = open('table.csv', 'w')
compute_data(out=file)
```

**Notes:** Accept file objects instead of filenames. Don't build complete solutions; provide example code and let users compose behavior.

---

### LANG-PATTERN: Avoid Patterns Replaced by Language Features

**Source:** The Classic Design Patterns: Where Are They Now? (2022)

**Principle:** Modern languages with first-class functions have rendered many classic patterns obsolete.

**Bad Example (Strategy Pattern with single-method classes):**
```python
# Old: Strategy Pattern with single-method classes
```

**Good Example (Just pass a function):**
```python
def paragraph_break(text):
    return text.split('\n\n')

formatter = Application(paragraph_break)
```

**Notes:** Six patterns (Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Template Method, Strategy, Command, Visitor) are unnecessary with first-class functions—just pass functions/classes directly.

---

### GEN-ITER: Generators Replace Iterator Pattern

**Source:** The Classic Design Patterns: Where Are They Now? (2022)

**Principle:** Use generators instead of implementing the Iterator Pattern.

**Good Example:**
```python
# Generator approach (cleaner than Iterator Pattern)
def producer():
    for item in items:
        yield item

for item in producer():
    process(item)
```

**Notes:** Avoid direct producer-consumer chains. Generate complete data structures first, then consume them. Quote from Rhodes: "Show me your _flowchart_ and conceal your tables, and I shall continue to be mystified." (Fred Brooks)

---

### DJANGO-CMD: Django Command Pattern

**Source:** The Classic Design Patterns: Where Are They Now? (2022)

**Principle:** Represent actions as objects with `do()`/`undo()` methods for migrations.

**Good Example:**
```python
# Django migrations use Command Pattern
v1: CreateModel, CreateModel, AddIndex
v2: AlterModelTable, AddField
v3: RenameField
```

**Notes:** Framework patterns that dominate modern frameworks include Composite, Chain of Responsibility, Command, and Interpreter.

---

### COMP-INHERIT: Composition Over Inheritance

**Source:** When Python Practices Go Wrong (2019)

**Principle:** Use composition with parameters instead of creating complex class hierarchies.

**Notes:** Classes encourage specialization (subclassing), creating m×n problems. Better approach: composition with `target=` parameter. Progression: Mixins → Bridge Pattern → Pipeline Architecture using data structures and functions.

---

### COPERNICAN: Copernican Refactoring - Centering the Right Thing

**Source:** Copernican Refactoring (2013)

**Principle:** Moving something fundamentally new into a system's center can dramatically simplify overall complexity.

**Modern Examples Cited:**
- **USB car chargers:** Centralizing around USB eliminated specialized cables
- **Mercedes engine bolts:** Redesigning the receptacle solved the problem systematically
- **Dependency injection:** Pulling I/O operations to higher architectural levels
- **docopt:** Replacing verbose argparse declarations with human-readable docstrings at the center
- **Django framework:** Centralizing URL routing eliminates repetitive regex matching and conditional logic across individual view functions

**Key Takeaway:** "When code feels backward or requires excessive workarounds, consider whether a Copernican refactoring—repositioning a central element—could provide elegant simplification rather than incremental fixes."

**Notes:** This is an architectural principle rather than a coding guideline with examples, but it's a powerful refactoring heuristic.

---

### PYTHON-PATTERNS: When Python Makes Patterns Unnecessary

**Source:** Python Design Patterns 1 (2012)

**Principle:** Many Gang of Four patterns are unnecessary in Python due to language features.

**Patterns Made Unnecessary:**
- **Abstract Factory, Factory Method** - Python has no `new` keyword; functions can return any type
- **Singleton** - Use module-level instances or functions instead of class-based implementations
- **Strategy Pattern** - Often replaced by first-class functions and callbacks
- **Template Method** - Subclassing replaced with callable parameters
- **Iterator** - "Most important Python innovation" (2001); generators and `yield` make classic Iterator pattern obsolete

**Example from talk:**
```python
# Duck typing eliminates need for interfaces
# writeZen(out) works with any object having write() method
```

**Key Insight:** "We tend to write glue because the Open Source community handles the hard parts." Python developers write small, focused tools; large applications use frameworks that embed pattern implementations.

**Bonus - Dependency Injection:**
**Problem:** Hard-coded dependencies make testing difficult
**Solution:** Pass dependencies as parameters rather than calling them internally
**Practical Alternative:** Structure code so high-level functions assemble and run components

**Notes:** While this talk doesn't provide bad/good code comparisons, it explicitly identifies which patterns Python's features replace.

---

## API Design

### EXPLICIT-NAME: Use Explicit Method Names

**Source:** Skyfield and 15 Years of Bad APIs (2013)

**Principle:** Use clear, explicit method names that reveal intent.

**Bad Example (PyEphem):**
```python
m.a_ra, m.a_dec
```

**Good Example (Skyfield):**
```python
earth(d).observe(mars).astrometric()
```

**Notes:** Explicit method names make code self-documenting.

---

### NO-MUTSTATE: Avoid Mutable State

**Source:** Skyfield and 15 Years of Bad APIs (2013)

**Principle:** Return new objects instead of storing mutable state on objects.

**Bad Example (PyEphem):**
```python
mars = ephem.Mars()
mars.compute('2012/11/9')
print(mars.ra, mars.dec)
```

**Good Example (Skyfield):**
```python
coords = [mars(d).astrometric() for d in dates]
```

**Notes:** Avoid storing computation results on objects as mutable state.

---

### SHOW-COST: Expensive Operations Should Look Like Calls

**Source:** Skyfield and 15 Years of Bad APIs (2013)

**Principle:** Hide quick conveniences behind properties; expensive operations must look like function calls.

**Bad Example:**
```python
print(m.name)        # zero work
print(m.rise_time)   # expensive operation - looks the same!
```

**Notes:** Properties should only be used for cheap operations. Expensive computations should require explicit method calls.

---

### NO-MUTARGS: Avoid Mutation Through Methods

**Source:** Skyfield and 15 Years of Bad APIs (2013)

**Principle:** Methods serve as Python's built-in typechecking. Functions shouldn't mutate arguments.

**Bad Example (PyEphem mutation problem):**
```python
toronto.next_rising(m)
print(m.ra)  # Different value!
```

**Notes:** Guidelines: 1) Methods serve as Python's built-in typechecking, 2) Functions `f(x)` should only touch public features, 3) Functions shouldn't mutate arguments, 4) Methods are discoverable.

---

### SCALAR-NUMPY: Scalar Style with NumPy

**Source:** Skyfield and 15 Years of Bad APIs (2013)

**Principle:** Code should work identically on scalars and arrays.

**Good Example:**
```python
jd = today()
p = earth(jd).observe(planet)

jd = date_range('1980/1/1', '2010/1/1', 1.0)
p = earth(jd).observe(planet)  # Same code
```

**Notes:** Using NumPy enables scalar-style code that automatically works with arrays.

---

### SAFE-DEFAULT: Default to Safety in API Design

**Source:** The Naming of Ducks (2013)

**Principle:** APIs should default to the safer option, requiring explicit opt-in for dangerous operations.

**Example:**
- `yaml.safe_load()` should be the default
- Dangerous operations should be explicit like `yaml.dangerous_load()`

**Notes:** This principle was mentioned in The Naming of Ducks but didn't have a code example - it's an important API design guideline.

---

## Code Organization and Structure

### NO-IMPORT-FX: Avoid Import-Time Side Effects

**Source:** When Python Practices Go Wrong (2019)

**Principle:** Keep `__init__.py` files code-free and avoid all import-time side effects.

**Notes:** Modules executing database queries or loading config at import time break testability. All side effects should happen at function call time, not import time.

---

### TOP-DOWN: Code Should Read Top-Down

**Source:** The Antipodes (2019)

**Principle:** Organize code naturally with main logic first, helpers after (not inverted like C requires).

**Notes:** C programmers inverted code structure (helpers first, main() last) due to forward-declaration requirements. Python doesn't have this limitation—organize code naturally.

---

### DATA-FLOW: Organize by Data Transformations

**Source:** The Clean Architecture in Python (2014)

**Principle:** Show tables/data structures rather than flowcharts.

**Notes:** Fred Brooks (1975): "Show me your tables, and I won't usually need your flowchart; it'll be obvious." McIlroy vs. Knuth (1986): A 6-line shell script outperformed Knuth's 10-page Pascal program through stepwise data transformation.

---

## Object-Oriented Programming

### EXPLICIT-BOOL: Avoid Implicit Boolean

**Source:** When Python Practices Go Wrong (2019)

**Principle:** Use explicit comparisons instead of relying on `__bool__()` for type clarity.

**Bad Example:**
```python
if seq:  # Type desert - what is seq?
```

**Good Example:**
```python
if len(users):  # Clear: checking container
if users > 0:   # Clear: checking number
```

**Notes:** PEP 8 encourages brevity with `if seq:` instead of `if len(seq) > 0:`, but this creates a "type desert"—anything can implement `__bool__()`. Explicit comparisons improve readability.

---

### NO-CALL: Avoid __call__() for Readability

**Source:** When Python Practices Go Wrong (2019)

**Principle:** Use explicit method names instead of `__call__()` to improve code clarity.

**Bad Example:**
```python
return get_template(args)()()  # What do these calls mean?
```

**Good Example:**
```python
# Use explicit method names like bind() and flatten()
```

**Notes:** Objects can implement `__call__()` to behave like functions, but this obscures intent.

---

### NO-GLOBAL-MUT: Global Mutable State Anti-Pattern

**Source:** When Python Practices Go Wrong (2019)

**Principle:** Avoid using mutable globals to eliminate repetition.

**Notes:** Using mutable globals creates problems: data enters functions from multiple directions, testing requires mutating globals, threading causes race conditions, unclear data provenance.

---

## Data Structures

### DICT-JOIN: Dictionary Join Pattern

**Source:** Sine Qua Nons: Python Programming Essentials (2013)

**Principle:** Use dictionaries for constant-time lookups to avoid O(nm) performance problems.

**Good Example:**
```python
years = {}
for line in open('students.txt'):
    name, year = line.split()
    years[name] = year

for line in open('semester.txt'):
    name, course = line.split()
    year = years[name]  # O(1) lookup
```

**Advanced Example:**
```python
from collections import Counter, defaultdict

enrollment = defaultdict(Counter)
for line in open('semester.txt'):
    name, course = line.split()
    year = years[name]
    enrollment[course][year] += 1
```

**Notes:** This mirrors database Hash Join optimization.

---

### NAMED-TUPLE: Named Tuples for Type Safety

**Source:** Sine Qua Nons: Python Programming Essentials (2013)

**Principle:** Use named tuples instead of bare tuples for better documentation and error messages.

**Bad Example (Generic):**
```python
points = [(3,4), (5,12), (15,8)]
# Error: IndexError: list index out of range
```

**Good Example (Named tuple):**
```python
from collections import namedtuple
Point = namedtuple('Point', 'x y')
points = [Point(3,4), Point(5,12)]
# Error: AttributeError: no attribute 'z'
```

**Notes:** Named tuples provide attributes and better error messages.

---

### NUMPY-VECTOR: NumPy Vector Math

**Source:** Sine Qua Nons: Python Programming Essentials (2013)

**Principle:** Use NumPy for elegant vectorized operations.

**Good Example:**
```python
from numpy import array, sqrt

x = array([3, 5, 15])
y = array([4, 12, 8])

print sqrt(x*x + y*y)
# => [ 5. 13. 17.]
```

**Notes:** NumPy enables elegant vectorized operations that work on entire arrays at once.

---

### LIST-FRONT: Avoid O(n) at Front

**Source:** All Your Ducks In A Row: Data Structures (2014)

**Principle:** Never use `pop(0)` or `insert(0, v)` on large lists.

**Notes:** Danger zones: `pop(0)` or `insert(0, v)` on large lists are O(n) operations. Iterating backwards via `pop(0)`: million-item list = half trillion operations. Safe alternatives: Use `collections.deque` for double-ended operations, iterate with `reversed()`, use NumPy views for large slicing.

---

### DICT-COMP: Dictionary Comprehensions

**Source:** The Dictionary Even Mightier (2017)

**Principle:** Use dictionary comprehensions for more readable, faster code.

**Evolution:**
```python
# List comprehension (Python 2.0)
[n*n for n in numbers]

# Generator expression (Python 2.4)
dict((n, n*n) for n in numbers)

# Dictionary comprehension (Python 3.0)
{n: n*n for n in numbers}
```

**Notes:** Benefits include more readable syntax, smaller bytecode, and faster execution.

---

### KEY-SHARE: Key-Sharing in __init__()

**Source:** The Dictionary Even Mightier (2017)

**Principle:** Assign every possible attribute in `__init__()` for maximum memory efficiency.

**Notes:** Python 3.3+ shares common keys structure across instances, reducing memory by ~2/3. Object-oriented programs use 10–20% less memory when all attributes are assigned in `__init__()`.

---

## Performance and Optimization

### ORM-KNOW: ORM - Understanding vs Hiding

**Source:** Flexing SQLAlchemy's Relational Power (2012)

**Principle:** Developers mistake "Object-Relational Mapper" to mean "Relational Hider." Using an ORM still requires understanding relational concepts and SQL joins.

**Common ORM Mistakes:**
1. **Lazy loading in loops** - Accessing attributes that trigger separate queries (N+1 problem)
2. **Multiple simple queries** - Breaking one logical question into many database calls
3. **Ignoring eager loading** - Not using `joinedload()` or `subqueryload()` options

**Practical Solutions:**
- Enable SQLAlchemy logging with `echo=True` during development
- Use `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` to analyze problematic queries
- Aggregate all conditions into single queries using `.join()` and `.filter()`
- Utilize outer joins when needed for left-side rows without matches

**Philosophy:** "disk access must be minimized" - asking the database a single comprehensive question rather than multiple simple queries

**Notes:** While the original talk doesn't show bad/good code side-by-side, these are explicit anti-patterns Rhodes identified.

---

### SELENIUM-HIGH: Selenium Testing - Higher-Level Libraries

**Source:** Using Python to power Selenium at scale (2016)

**Principle:** Use higher-level testing libraries to write more reliable tests.

**Good Example (Capybara.py):**
```python
page.click_link("Schedule")  # instead of find('.navigation__link').click()
```

**Notes:** Key principles: Verify element visibility before interaction, ensure element accessibility, minimize JavaScript round-trips, interact like humans would.

---

### NO-EVAL: Avoid eval() in Application Code

**Source:** When Python Practices Go Wrong (2019)

**Principle:** eval() has limited legitimate use in application code but extensive utility in developer tools.

**Notes:** Beginners often misuse it: `eval('my_object.' + name)` should be `getattr(my_object, name)`. Legitimate uses: namedtuple, doctests, Jupyter notebooks. Greatest success: eval() powers interactive tools, not application code.

---

## Naming Conventions

### PRECISE-NOUN: Well-Factored Nouns

**Source:** The Naming of Ducks (2013)

**Principle:** Nouns should precisely describe objects. When discovering imprecise variable name, refactor throughout.

**Bad Example:**
```python
page = 'http://example.com'  # page is actually a URL
```

**Good Example:**
```python
url = 'http://example.com'  # or page_url
response = requests.get(url)  # clarifies HTTP response objects
```

**Notes:** In duck-typed Python, names are critical for communicating intent.

---

### USE-VERBS: Relentless Verbs

**Source:** The Naming of Ducks (2013)

**Principle:** Functions should use verbs: `create_database()` rather than `database()`.

**Notes:** Methods are exceptions since parentheses clarify. Math-like functions can omit verbs: `length(center(boston))`.

---

### NO-SYNEC: Sin of Synecdoche

**Source:** The Naming of Ducks (2013)

**Principle:** Don't confuse name with what it references.

**Bad Example:**
```python
song = 'http://lyrics.com/a-sitting-on-a-gate'  # Wrong
```

**Good Example:**
```python
song_url = 'http://lyrics.com/a-sitting-on-a-gate'  # Right
song_text = 'A sitting on a gate'
```

**Notes:** Namespaces can absolve: `fetch_songs()` in medialib but `fetch()` in songlib.

---

### AVOID-PLURAL: Problem of Pluralization

**Source:** The Naming of Ducks (2013)

**Principle:** Avoid plural names for collections; use type-specific suffixes.

**Notes:** Three issues with plurals: 1) Ambiguity - `connections` could be list, dict, deque, 2) English irregularity - feet/boxes/brethren/species, 3) Counting confusion - `connections = 8` contradicts plural semantics.

**Good Examples:**
```python
# For known types
connection_list, connection_dict

# For interface-focused
connection_seq, connection_map

# Scientific Python uses singulars
x = linspace(-10.0, 10.0, 200)
```

**Notes:** Document collections singularly: Use `vector_map` with comment "scientific name → vector".

---

## Code Style and Formatting

### LINE-LENGTH: PEP-8 Line Length and Typography

**Source:** A Python Æsthetic (2012) & The Naming of Ducks (2013)

**Principle:** 79-character limit connects to typography principles.

**Notes:** Robert Bringhurst: "66 characters is widely regarded as ideal" for single-column pages. Trailing commas in multi-line function calls create symmetry friendly to version control.

---

### OP-BEFORE: Breaking Long Lines - Operators Before

**Source:** A Python Æsthetic (2012)

**Principle:** Break before operators for mathematical clarity (following Knuth's research).

**Good Example:**
```python
adjusted_income = (gross_wages
    + taxable_interest
    - ira_deduction)
```

**Notes:** PEP-8 recommends breaking after operators, but Knuth's research favors breaking before for mathematical clarity.

---

### DOT-START: Method Chaining - Period at Line Start

**Source:** A Python Æsthetic (2012)

**Principle:** Place period at line start for method chains.

**Good Example:**
```python
query = (Person
    .filter(last_name='Smith')
    .order_by('social_security_number')
    .select_related('spouse')
)
```

**Notes:** Keeps version control clean and makes chaining obvious.

---

### ARG-PER-LINE: Argument-Per-Line Style

**Source:** A Python Æsthetic (2012)

**Principle:** Use one argument per line for function calls with many parameters.

**Good Example:**
```python
function(
    x=arg1,
    y=arg2,
    z=arg3,
)
```

**Notes:** Keeps version control clean by isolating changes to single lines.

---

### NAME-COMMENT: Naming Over Comments

**Source:** A Python Æsthetic (2012)

**Principle:** Intermediate variables improve readability.

**Good Example:**
```python
message = 'Please press {}'.format(key)
canvas.drawString(x, y, message)
```

**Notes:** Self-documenting code through good naming is better than comments.

---

### INDENT-LIMIT: Indentation Discipline

**Source:** A Python Æsthetic (2012)

**Principle:** If you need more than 3 levels of indentation, you're screwed anyway.

**Notes:** Linus Torvalds quote. Rhodes uses four techniques: `continue` statements, method extraction, function factoring, iterator separation.

---

## Developer Productivity

### TOOL-INVEST: Tool Investment Framework

**Source:** Stopping to Sharpen Your Tools (2015)

**Principle:** Balance focused work with tool maintenance using two criteria.

**Decision Framework:**
1. **Repetition** - When boredom signals repeated tasks, automate
2. **Traction** - Continue coding while making progress; pause when flailing

**Historic Examples:**
- Donald Knuth spent a year developing Metafont and TeX rather than struggling with inferior tools
- Guido van Rossum created Python because "development of system administration utilities in C was taking too long"

**Warning:** Excessive tool tweaking can become procrastination - beware of avoiding real work

**Self-Awareness:** "Your most important tool to keep sharp is yourself" - awareness of personal state (hunger, thirst, mood, frustration) matters as much as technical tool knowledge

**Notes:** While not a coding guideline with examples, this is practical advice from Rhodes about when to invest in tooling vs when to code.

---

## Advanced Topics

### EXCEPT-HIER: Exception Hierarchy for Clean Error Handling

**Source:** Sine Qua Nons: Python Programming Essentials (2013)

**Principle:** Define custom exception hierarchy and use Flask error handlers to eliminate error-checking code from view functions.

**Good Example:**
```python
# 1. Define Custom Exception Hierarchy
class AppError(Exception): ...
class NotFoundError(AppError): ...
class PermissionError(AppError): ...
class DatabaseError(AppError): ...
class AuthError(AppError): ...

# 2. Raise in Business Logic
def db_load(cls, key):
    if obj is None:
        raise NotFoundError()

# 3. Flask Error Handlers
@app.errorhandler(DatabaseError)
@json_response
def handle_database_error(error):
    return {'error': 'unavailable'}, 503
```

**Caveat for Partial Failures:**
```python
user = get_row(user, name, default=None)
data = user.cloud_open(filename, default='')
```

**Notes:** Pervasive exceptions eliminate error-checking code from business logic.

---

### TERM-SETTINGS: Terminal Settings Management

**Source:** Animating with ASCII (2017)

**Principle:** Manage terminal settings for interactive applications.

**Key termios flags:**
```python
# Turning flags off
oflags = oflags & ~termios.ECHO
```

**Notes:** `ONLCR` maps newline to carriage return + newline, `ECHO` echoes input characters, `ICANON` enables canonical (buffered) mode.

---

### ANSI-ESC: ANSI Escape Codes

**Source:** Animating with ASCII (2017)

**Good Example:**
```python
HIDE_CURSOR = ESC + '[?25l'
GOTO_ORIGIN = ESC + '[H'
```

**Notes:** Used for terminal control in ASCII animations.

---

### CANVAS-DATA: Canvas Data Structure

**Source:** Animating with ASCII (2017)

**Principle:** Use multi-layer representation for graphics.

**Good Example:**
```python
canvas = [
    [characters],     # Text content
    [foreground RGB], # Foreground colors
    [background RGB]  # Background colors
]
```

**Notes:** Three-layer representation enables flexible rendering.

---

### PASS-FUNC: Effect Composition - Pass Functions Not Data

**Source:** Animating with ASCII (2017)

**Principle:** Pass `scrawl` as a verb instead of canvas as a noun.

**Notes:** Enables nested animations, transparent effect composition, and better code organization. Design for composability using closures to capture animation parameters.

---

### VENV-SANDBOX: Virtualenv Project Sandboxes

**Source:** Sine Qua Nons: Python Programming Essentials (2013)

**Principle:** Virtual environments isolate project dependencies.

**Good Example:**
```bash
$ cd ~/project
$ virtualenv venv
$ venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Example dependency specification:**
```
de421==2008
jplephem==1.1
numpy==1.7.1
sgp4==1.1
```

**Notes:** Each project maintains its own `requirements.txt` for reproducible environments.

---

### CTYPES-INTRO: Complete Object Introspection with ctypes

**Source:** Sine Qua Nons: Python Programming Essentials (2013)

**Principle:** Python's leading underscores mark implementation details while permitting access.

**Good Example:**
```python
object._name  # "Don't use this, but you can"

# Accessing internal SSL structures
addr = id(conn.sock._sslobj)
ptype = ctypes.POINTER(PySSLObject)
obj = ctypes.cast(addr, ptype).contents
```

**Notes:** Tradeoffs - Costs: no guarantee, minimal documentation, vulnerable to version changes. Benefit: code reuse without modification.

---

### DJANGO-TXN: Transaction Management in Django 1.6

**Source:** Moving Targets (2014)

**Principle:** Use explicit transactions with `@transaction.atomic()`.

**Good Example:**
```python
with transaction.atomic():
    # code here
```

**Notes:** Django 1.6+ shifted to auto-commit as default; transactions now explicit.

---

### DATA-COMMENT: Comments as Data Pictures

**Source:** Know Thy Database (2011)

**Principle:** Show data transformations in comments.

**Good Example:**
```python
w = name.split()  # ['Dr.', 'Ed', 'Smith', 'Jr.']
```

**Notes:** Rather than dismissing comments, Rhodes advocates showing data transformations to aid understanding.

---

### HASH-CLASS: Hashing Custom Classes

**Source:** The Mighty Dictionary (2010)

**Principle:** Classes implementing `__hash__()` should follow specific rules.

**Notes:** Should: scatter bits unpredictably, ensure equal instances have equal hashes, implement `__eq__()` consistently, prioritize speed. A simple approach: XOR the hashes of instance variables.

---

## Module Design and Advanced Patterns

**Source:** Brandon Rhodes - Python Patterns Guide (python-patterns.guide)

These guidelines come from Brandon Rhodes' Python Patterns Guide, covering module-level design, advanced patterns, and anti-patterns to avoid.

---

### MODULE-CONST: Use Module-Level Constants

**Source:** python-patterns.guide - Global Object Pattern

**Principle:** Define immutable constants at module level for clarity, efficiency, and maintainability.

**Good Example:**
```python
# Immutable values
January = 1                    # calendar.py
WARNING = 30                   # logging.py
MAX_INTERPOLATION_DEPTH = 10   # configparser.py

# Immutable containers
all_errors = (Error, OSError, EOFError)  # ftplib.py
DIGITS = frozenset("0123456789")         # sre_parse.py
_EPOCH = datetime(1970, 1, 1, tzinfo=timezone.utc)
```

**Why this matters:** Improves readability through descriptive names, centralizes values for single-point editing, and documents meaning through naming.

---

### IMPORT-COMPUTE: Use Import-Time Computation for Constants

**Source:** python-patterns.guide - Global Object Pattern

**Principle:** Perform expensive computations once at import time rather than repeatedly at runtime.

**Good Example:**
```python
# Avoid repeated calculations
ZIP_FILECOUNT_LIMIT = (1 << 16) - 1
INFINITY = float('inf')
COPY_BUFSIZE = 1024 * 1024 if _WINDOWS else 16 * 1024

# types.py example - compute once
def _f(): pass
FunctionType = type(_f)

# Compiled regular expressions
escapesre = re.compile(r'[\\"\]')
magic_check = re.compile('([*?[]])')
```

**Tradeoffs:** Shifts compilation cost from runtime to import time and eliminates repeated computation during execution, but every program importing the module pays the cost even if unused.

---

### NO-IMPORT-IO: Never Perform I/O at Import Time

**Source:** python-patterns.guide - Global Object Pattern

**Principle:** Never open files or network connections during module import.

**Why this matters:** "Errors at import time are far more serious than errors at runtime" — logging and exception handling aren't yet initialized. Applications designed to survive feature failures die completely if import fails.

**Bad Example:**
```python
# Opening files at import time
config_data = open('/etc/myapp.conf').read()  # BAD!
```

**Best Practice:** Defer I/O operations until first method call, when the program is running and needs are confirmed.

---

### NO-MUTABLE-GLOBAL: Avoid Mutable Global Objects

**Source:** python-patterns.guide - Global Object Pattern

**Principle:** Mutable globals create dangerous coupling between distant code sections.

**Problematic Examples:**
```python
# System resource coordination (justified but risky)
environ = _createenviron()  # os.py
_current_process = _MainProcess()  # multiprocessing
root = RootLogger(WARNING)  # logging
```

**Dangers:** Tests become coupled and cannot run safely in parallel. One test's modifications affect others if state isn't restored. Refactoring can unexpectedly call code manipulating the global mid-operation.

**Guidance:** Use immutable constants freely; avoid mutable globals except for inherent system resources.

---

### PREBOUND-METHOD: Use Prebound Method Pattern for Shared State

**Source:** python-patterns.guide - Prebound Method Pattern

**Principle:** Offer callables at module level that share state through a common hidden object instance.

**Bad Example (Global Variables):**
```python
from datetime import datetime

_seed = datetime.now().microsecond % 255 + 1

def set_seed(value):
    global _seed
    _seed = value

def random():
    global _seed
    _seed, carry = divmod(_seed, 2)
    if carry:
        _seed ^= 0xb8
    return _seed
```

**Good Example (Prebound Methods):**
```python
class Random8(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.set_seed(datetime.now().microsecond % 255 + 1)

    def set_seed(self, value):
        self.seed = value

    def random(self):
        self.seed, carry = divmod(self.seed, 2)
        if carry:
            self.seed ^= 0xb8
        return self.seed

_instance = Random8()
random = _instance.random
set_seed = _instance.set_seed
```

**When to use:** For lightweight objects that can be instantiated without substantial delay, this pattern elegantly makes stateful behavior available at module level.

---

### SENTINEL-OBJ: Use Sentinel Objects for Missing Values

**Source:** python-patterns.guide - Sentinel Object Pattern

**Principle:** Use unique object instances to indicate missing or unspecified data, especially when `None` might be a legitimate value.

**Good Example:**
```python
sentinel = object()
result = cache_get(key, sentinel)
if result is not sentinel:  # Identity check, not equality
    ...
```

**Key Principles:** Always use Python's `is` operator (identity check), not `==` (equality). Use for data stores where `None` is legitimate, detecting optional keyword arguments, and cache implementations.

**Standard Library Examples:** `functools.lru_cache()`, `bz2` module's `_sentinel`, `configparser` module's `_UNSET`.

---

### DECORATOR-DYNAMIC: Use Dynamic Wrappers for Decorator Pattern

**Source:** python-patterns.guide - Decorator Pattern

**Principle:** Implement specialized methods explicitly, use `__getattr__()` for everything else.

**Bad Example (Static Wrapper):**
```python
class WriteLoggingFile1(object):
    def __init__(self, file, logger):
        self._file = file
        self._logger = logger

    # Must implement every method, getter, setter, deleter
    def __enter__(self):
        return self._file.__enter__()

    @property
    def closed(self):
        return self._file.closed
    # ... dozens more lines ...
```

**Good Example (Dynamic Wrapper):**
```python
class WriteLoggingFile3(object):
    def __init__(self, file, logger):
        self._file = file
        self._logger = logger

    # Specialize only what needs it
    def write(self, s):
        self._file.write(s)
        self._logger.debug('wrote %s bytes to %s', len(s), self._file)

    # Delegate everything else dynamically
    def __getattr__(self, name):
        return getattr(self.__dict__['_file'], name)

    def __setattr__(self, name, value):
        if name in ('_file', '_logger'):
            self.__dict__[name] = value
        else:
            setattr(self.__dict__['_file'], name, value)
```

**Advantages:** Concise, maintainable code that handles future changes automatically.

### NO-SINGLETON: Avoid the Singleton Pattern

**Source:** python-patterns.guide - Singleton Pattern

**Principle:** Use the Global Object Pattern instead of Singleton for cleaner, more Pythonic code.

**Bad Example (Singleton):**
```python
class Logger(object):
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super(Logger, cls).__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance
```

**Good Example (Global Object Pattern):**
```python
# logger.py
class _Logger:
    pass

logger = _Logger()
```

**Why NOT Singleton:** The `__new__()` method confuses developers, calls like `Logger()` mislead about creating new instances, and it eliminates testing flexibility.

### NO-BUILDER-ARGS: Avoid Builder Pattern for Optional Arguments

**Source:** python-patterns.guide - Builder Pattern

**Principle:** Never use Builder pattern to simulate optional arguments—Python supports them natively.

**Bad Example (Unnecessary Builder):**
```python
class PortBuilder(object):
    def __init__(self, port):
        self.port = port
        self.name = None
        self.protocol = None

    def build(self):
        return Port(self.port, self.name, self.protocol)

b = PortBuilder(517)
b.protocol = 'UDP'
b.build()
```

**Good Example (Native Python):**
```python
from typing import NamedTuple

class Port(NamedTuple):
    number: int
    name: str = ''
    protocol: str = ''

# Python's native optional arguments:
Port(2)
Port(7, 'echo')
Port(517, protocol='UDP')
```

**When to use Builder:** Use for convenience when hiding complex object creation (like matplotlib), NOT to simulate Python's native features.

---

### COMPOSITE-SYM: Use Composite Pattern for Symmetric Operations

**Source:** python-patterns.guide - Composite Pattern

**Principle:** Create symmetry between container objects and their contents by giving them a shared set of methods.

**Good Example (Tkinter):**
```python
def print_tree(widget, indent=0):
    """Print a hierarchy of Tk widgets."""
    print('{:<{}} * {!r}'.format('', indent * 4, widget))
    for child in widget.winfo_children():  # List for containers, empty for leaves
        print_tree(child, indent + 1)
```

**Key Insight:** All Tk widgets expose `winfo_children()` which returns a list or empty list, eliminating `isinstance()` checks.

**Best Practice:** "If your desire to create symmetry requires an `if` statement or `isinstance()` to safely handle return values, the desire for symmetry has led you astray."

### NO-SCATTERED-IFS: Avoid Scattered Conditionals

**Source:** python-patterns.guide - Composition Over Inheritance

**Principle:** Scattered `if` statements across methods create maintenance nightmares.

**Bad Example:**
```python
class Logger:
    def __init__(self, pattern=None, file=None, sock=None):
        self.pattern = pattern
        self.file = file
        self.sock = sock

    def log(self, message):
        if self.pattern is not None:
            if self.pattern not in message:
                return
        if self.file is not None:
            self.file.write(message + '\n')
        if self.sock is not None:
            self.sock.sendall((message + '\n').encode('ascii'))
```

**Problems:** Feature code scattered across methods, difficult deletion, dead code undetectable, testing complexity, efficiency issues.

**Solution:** Use composition to separate concerns into distinct classes.

---

### NO-MULTI-INHERIT: Avoid Multiple Inheritance

**Source:** python-patterns.guide - Composition Over Inheritance

**Principle:** Multiple inheritance creates complexity and testing nightmares.

**Bad Example:**
```python
class FilteredSocketLogger(FilteredLogger, SocketLogger):
    def __init__(self, pattern, sock):
        FilteredLogger.__init__(self, pattern, None)
        SocketLogger.__init__(self, sock)
```

**Problems:** Unit tests of base classes don't guarantee combined behavior works. Each combination requires new `__init__()` and tests. Attribute name collisions possible. MRO complexity. Cannot swap implementations at runtime.

**Solution:** Use composition—inject dependencies through constructor parameters.

## Summary of Key Principles

Brandon Rhodes' presentations emphasize several recurring themes:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep I/O separate from business logic
2. **Pure Functions**: Prefer pure functions that are easy to test
3. **Explicit Over Implicit**: Clear naming and explicit operations
4. **Data Over Control Flow**: Show data structures, not flowcharts
5. **Composition Over Inheritance**: Use functions and data structures
6. **Avoid Mocking**: Architecture problems, not testing solutions
7. **Language Features Over Patterns**: Use Python's built-in capabilities
8. **Readable Code**: Self-documenting through good naming and structure
