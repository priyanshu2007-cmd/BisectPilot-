### 4. SOLID Principles

- **Sources:** Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob), various educational resources
- **Used for:** Object-oriented design principles
- **License:** Educational principles, widely documented

**The Five Principles:**

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - A class should have only one reason to change
   - Guideline: SRP-VIOLATION

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - Open for extension, closed for modification
   - Guideline: OCP-VIOLATION

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - Subtypes must be substitutable for base types
   - Guideline: LSP-VIOLATION

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - Clients shouldn't depend on interfaces they don't use
   - (Less applicable to JavaScript, but covered in design)

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - Depend on abstractions, not concretions
   - Guideline: DIP-VIOLATION

**Relevant Guidelines:**
- SRP-VIOLATION - Single Responsibility Principle
- OCP-VIOLATION - Open/Closed Principle
- LSP-VIOLATION - Liskov Substitution Principle
- DIP-VIOLATION - Dependency Inversion Principle
- INJECT-DEP - Dependency Injection (supports DIP)

## Refactoring Philosophy Summary

This skill follows Martin Fowler's refactoring philosophy:

1. **Refactoring is NOT rewriting** - Incremental improvements
2. **Two hats approach** - Add features OR refactor, not both
3. **Small steps** - Each refactoring is a small, safe change
4. **Tests are essential** - Ensure refactoring doesn't break behavior
5. **Code smells guide refactoring** - Indicators of where to improve
6. **Refactoring improves design** - Not just cosmetic changes

Combined with modern JavaScript best practices:
- Use modern syntax (ES6+)
- Favor functional patterns (pure functions, immutability)
- Write testable code (dependency injection, loose coupling)
- Follow SOLID principles
- Keep it simple (KISS principle)

---

**Note:** This skill prioritizes practical refactoring techniques that improve real-world JavaScript/TypeScript code. The goal is to help developers write maintainable, testable, and performant code through systematic refactoring.
