## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: How to Run This Review

1. **Run as a sub-task using the Task tool** - This ensures fresh context dedicated to the review, with no interference from prior conversation.

2. **Output a markdown file** - Write the review report to a `.md` file (not just console output). The file must include:
   - Each issue with its mnemonic ID
   - Problematic code snippets
   - Suggested improvements
   - Reasoning for each recommendation

**Example invocation:**
```
Use the Task tool to run python-refactoring-reviewer on src/module.py and write the report to reviews/module-refactoring.md
```

# Complete Refactoring Guidelines

## 1. READABILITY

### MEANINGFUL-NAME: Use Meaningful Variable Names

**Intent:** Readability

**Code Smell:** Unclear naming, cryptic abbreviations

**Bad code:**
```python
def calc(x, y, z):
    t = x * y
    r = t - z
    return r
```

**Good code:**
```python
def calculate_net_profit(revenue, cost_of_goods, operating_expenses):
    gross_profit = revenue - cost_of_goods
    net_profit = gross_profit - operating_expenses
    return net_profit
```

**Why this matters:**
- Code is read far more often than written
- Self-documenting names reduce cognitive load
- Clear intent eliminates need for comments

**Attribution:** clean-code-python (MIT), Refactoring Guru

---

### PRONOUNCE-NAME: Use Pronounceable Names

**Intent:** Readability

**Code Smell:** Unpronounceable abbreviations

**Bad code:**
```python
class DtaRcrd: # What is DtaRcrd?
    def __init__(self, f_name, l_name):
        self.f_name = f_name
        self.l_name = l_name
```

**Good code:**
```python
class DataRecord:
    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
```

**Why this matters:**
- Team discussions are easier with pronounceable names
- Reduces miscommunication in code reviews
- Improves searchability

**Attribution:** clean-code-python (MIT)

---

### SEARCHABLE-NAME: Use Searchable Names

**Intent:** Readability

**Code Smell:** Magic numbers, single-letter variables in large scopes

**Bad code:**
```python
# What is 86400?
time.sleep(86400)
```

**Good code:**
```python
SECONDS_IN_A_DAY = 86400
time.sleep(SECONDS_IN_A_DAY)
```

**Why this matters:**
- Easy to find all usages with search
- Clear semantic meaning
- Facilitates refactoring

**Attribution:** clean-code-python (MIT)

---

### AVOID-MENTAL-MAP: Avoid Mental Mapping

**Intent:** Readability

**Code Smell:** Cryptic variable names requiring translation

**Bad code:**
```python
locations = ["Austin", "New York", "San Francisco"]
for l in locations:
    do_stuff(l)
    do_some_other_stuff(l)
    # ...
    # What is `l` again?
```

**Good code:**
```python
locations = ["Austin", "New York", "San Francisco"]
for location in locations:
    do_stuff(location)
    do_some_other_stuff(location)
```

**Why this matters:**
- Explicit is better than implicit
- Reduces cognitive load
- No mental translation required

**Attribution:** clean-code-python (MIT)

---

### EXTRACT-METHOD: Extract Long Methods

**Intent:** Readability

**Code Smell:** Long Method

**Bad code:**
```python
def process_order(order):
    # Validate order
    if not order.items:
        raise ValueError("Empty order")
    if order.total < 0:
        raise ValueError("Negative total")

    # Calculate tax
    tax_rate = 0.08
    tax = order.subtotal * tax_rate

    # Apply discount
    if order.customer.is_premium:
        discount = order.subtotal * 0.1
    else:
        discount = 0

    # Calculate final total
    order.total = order.subtotal + tax - discount

    # Send confirmation
    email = f"Order confirmed: ${order.total}"
    send_email(order.customer.email, email)
```

**Good code:**
```python
def process_order(order):
    validate_order(order)
    tax = calculate_tax(order.subtotal)
    discount = calculate_discount(order)
    order.total = calculate_final_total(order.subtotal, tax, discount)
    send_order_confirmation(order)

def validate_order(order):
    if not order.items:
        raise ValueError("Empty order")
    if order.total < 0:
        raise ValueError("Negative total")

def calculate_tax(subtotal):
    TAX_RATE = 0.08
    return subtotal * TAX_RATE

def calculate_discount(order):
    PREMIUM_DISCOUNT_RATE = 0.1
    if order.customer.is_premium:
        return order.subtotal * PREMIUM_DISCOUNT_RATE
    return 0

def calculate_final_total(subtotal, tax, discount):
    return subtotal + tax - discount

def send_order_confirmation(order):
    message = f"Order confirmed: ${order.total}"
    send_email(order.customer.email, message)
```

**Why this matters:**
- Each function has one clear responsibility
- Easier to test individual pieces
- Self-documenting code structure
- Reusable components

**Attribution:** Refactoring Guru - Extract Method, clean-code-python

---

### EXTRACT-VAR: Extract Complex Expressions

**Intent:** Readability

**Code Smell:** Complex nested expressions

**Bad code:**
```python
if (user.age >= 18 and user.country == "US" and user.verified) or \
   (user.age >= 21 and user.country == "UK" and user.verified):
    grant_access()
```

**Good code:**
```python
is_adult_us_user = user.age >= 18 and user.country == "US" and user.verified
is_adult_uk_user = user.age >= 21 and user.country == "UK" and user.verified
can_access = is_adult_us_user or is_adult_uk_user

if can_access:
    grant_access()
```

**Why this matters:**
- Breaks down complex logic
- Self-documenting variable names
- Easier to debug

**Attribution:** Refactoring Guru - Extract Variable, clean-code-python

---

### DECOMPOSE-COND: Decompose Conditional

**Intent:** Readability

**Code Smell:** Complex conditional logic

**Bad code:**
```python
if date < SUMMER_START or date > SUMMER_END:
    charge = quantity * winter_rate + winter_service_charge
else:
    charge = quantity * summer_rate
```

**Good code:**
```python
def is_winter(date):
    return date < SUMMER_START or date > SUMMER_END

def calculate_winter_charge(quantity):
    return quantity * winter_rate + winter_service_charge

def calculate_summer_charge(quantity):
    return quantity * summer_rate

if is_winter(date):
    charge = calculate_winter_charge(quantity)
else:
    charge = calculate_summer_charge(quantity)
```

**Why this matters:**
- Clarifies condition intent
- Encapsulates calculation logic
- Easier to extend with new seasons/rates

**Attribution:** Refactoring Guru - Decompose Conditional

---

### LONG-FUNC: Avoid Long Functions

**Intent:** Readability, Maintainability

**Code Smell:** Long Method (>20 lines)

**Bad code:**
```python
def process_invoice(invoice_data):
    # Line 1-10: Validation
    if not invoice_data:
        raise ValueError("Empty invoice")
    if not invoice_data.get('customer'):
        raise ValueError("Missing customer")
    # ... more validation

    # Line 11-20: Calculation
    subtotal = 0
    for item in invoice_data['items']:
        subtotal += item['price'] * item['quantity']
    tax = subtotal * 0.08
    # ... more calculation

    # Line 21-30: Persistence
    db = Database()
    db.save_invoice(invoice_data)
    # ... more persistence

    # Line 31-40: Notification
    send_email(invoice_data['customer']['email'])
    # ... more notification
```

**Good code:**
```python
def process_invoice(invoice_data):
    validate_invoice(invoice_data)
    totals = calculate_totals(invoice_data)
    save_invoice(invoice_data, totals)
    notify_customer(invoice_data)

def validate_invoice(invoice_data):
    if not invoice_data:
        raise ValueError("Empty invoice")
    if not invoice_data.get('customer'):
        raise ValueError("Missing customer")

def calculate_totals(invoice_data):
    subtotal = sum(item['price'] * item['quantity']
                   for item in invoice_data['items'])
    tax = subtotal * TAX_RATE
    return {'subtotal': subtotal, 'tax': tax, 'total': subtotal + tax}

def save_invoice(invoice_data, totals):
    db = Database()
    db.save_invoice(invoice_data, totals)

def notify_customer(invoice_data):
    send_email(invoice_data['customer']['email'])
```

**Why this matters:**
- Functions should do one thing
- Limit to ~10-20 lines for readability
- Extract logical chunks into named methods

**Attribution:** Refactoring Guru - Long Method, clean-code-python

---

### LONG-PARAM: Reduce Parameter Lists

**Intent:** Readability

**Code Smell:** Long Parameter List (>3 parameters)

**Bad code:**
```python
def create_user(name, email, age, address, phone, city, state, zip_code):
    pass
```

**Good code:**
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class UserInfo:
    name: str
    email: str
    age: int

@dataclass
class Address:
    street: str
    city: str
    state: str
    zip_code: str
    phone: str

def create_user(user_info: UserInfo, address: Address):
    pass
```

**Why this matters:**
- Easier to understand function signature
- Groups related parameters
- Easier to extend without breaking callers

**Attribution:** Refactoring Guru - Long Parameter List, clean-code-python

---

### MAGIC-NUM: Replace Magic Numbers with Named Constants

**Intent:** Readability

**Code Smell:** Magic numbers without context

**Bad code:**
```python
def calculate_circumference(radius):
    return 2 * 3.14159 * radius
```

**Good code:**
```python
import math

def calculate_circumference(radius):
    return 2 * math.pi * radius

# Or for custom constants:
MAX_RETRIES = 3
TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 30
```

**Why this matters:**
- Clarifies meaning of literal values
- Single source of truth
- Easy to update

**Attribution:** Refactoring Guru - Replace Magic Number with Symbolic Constant

---

### COMMENT-WHY: Comment Why, Not What

**Intent:** Readability

**Code Smell:** Obvious comments, redundant comments

**Bad code:**
```python
# Increment counter
counter += 1

# Check if user is admin
if user.role == "admin":
    pass
```

**Good code:**
```python
# Workaround for legacy API that doesn't accept batch requests
# See ticket #1234
for item in items:
    process_individually(item)

# Business rule: Premium users get 30-day trial, standard get 7 days
trial_days = 30 if user.is_premium else 7
```

**Why this matters:**
- Code shows what, comments explain why
- Valuable for business rules and workarounds
- Avoids obvious noise

**Attribution:** clean-code-python (MIT)

---

### COMMENT-SMELL: Comments as Code Smell

**Intent:** Readability

**Code Smell:** Comments compensating for unclear code

**Bad code:**
```python
# Check if eligible for discount
# Must be premium and spent over 1000 in last 30 days
if u.p and u.s > 1000 and (datetime.now() - u.l).days < 30:
    apply_discount()
```

**Good code:**
```python
def is_eligible_for_discount(user):
    is_premium = user.is_premium
    spent_enough = user.total_spent > DISCOUNT_THRESHOLD
    recent_activity = (datetime.now() - user.last_purchase).days < 30
    return is_premium and spent_enough and recent_activity

if is_eligible_for_discount(user):
    apply_discount()
```

**Why this matters:**
- Self-documenting code needs fewer comments
- Extract method with descriptive name
- Code is always up-to-date, comments drift

**Attribution:** Refactoring Guru - Comments, clean-code-python

---

### NESTED-DEEP: Reduce Nesting Depth

**Intent:** Readability

**Code Smell:** Deep nesting (>3 levels)

**Bad code:**
```python
def process(data):
    if data:
        if data.is_valid:
            if data.user:
                if data.user.is_active:
                    return process_active_user(data)
```

**Good code:**
```python
def process(data):
    if not data:
        return None
    if not data.is_valid:
        return None
    if not data.user:
        return None
    if not data.user.is_active:
        return None

    return process_active_user(data)
```

**Why this matters:**
- Easier to follow linear flow
- Early returns reduce cognitive load
- Flat structure is more maintainable

**Attribution:** Refactoring Guru - Replace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses

---

### GUARD-CLAUSE: Use Guard Clauses

**Intent:** Readability

**Code Smell:** Nested conditionals hiding main logic

**Bad code:**
```python
def calculate_pay(employee):
    if employee.is_active:
        if employee.hours_worked > 0:
            return employee.hours_worked * employee.hourly_rate
        else:
            return 0
    else:
        return 0
```

**Good code:**
```python
def calculate_pay(employee):
    if not employee.is_active:
        return 0
    if employee.hours_worked <= 0:
        return 0

    return employee.hours_worked * employee.hourly_rate
```

**Why this matters:**
- Guards handle edge cases upfront
- Main logic is clearly visible
- Reduces nesting

**Attribution:** Refactoring Guru - Replace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses

---

### POSITIVE-COND: Prefer Positive Conditionals

**Intent:** Readability

**Code Smell:** Double negatives, confusing logic

**Bad code:**
```python
if not user.is_not_verified:
    grant_access()
```

**Good code:**
```python
if user.is_verified:
    grant_access()
```

**Why this matters:**
- Positive logic is easier to understand
- Avoids double negatives
- Clearer intent

**Attribution:** Clean code principles

---

### POLY-COND: Replace Conditional with Polymorphism

**Intent:** Readability, Maintainability

**Code Smell:** Type-checking conditionals

**Bad code:**
```python
def get_payment_fee(payment_method):
    if payment_method.type == "credit_card":
        return payment_method.amount * 0.029 + 0.30
    elif payment_method.type == "paypal":
        return payment_method.amount * 0.025 + 0.30
    elif payment_method.type == "bank_transfer":
        return payment_method.amount * 0.015
```

**Good code:**
```python
class PaymentMethod(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def get_fee(self):
        pass

class CreditCard(PaymentMethod):
    def __init__(self, amount):
        self.amount = amount

    def get_fee(self):
        return self.amount * 0.029 + 0.30

class PayPal(PaymentMethod):
    def __init__(self, amount):
        self.amount = amount

    def get_fee(self):
        return self.amount * 0.025 + 0.30

class BankTransfer(PaymentMethod):
    def __init__(self, amount):
        self.amount = amount

    def get_fee(self):
        return self.amount * 0.015

# Usage
fee = payment_method.get_fee()
```

**Why this matters:**
- Eliminates type-checking conditionals
- Easy to add new types without modifying existing code
- Follows Open/Closed Principle

**A more Pythonic alternative (for simple cases):**

For scenarios where the logic is simple and can be represented as data, a dictionary of functions (or lambdas) can be more direct and less verbose.

```python
def get_credit_card_fee(amount):
    return amount * 0.029 + 0.30

def get_paypal_fee(amount):
    return amount * 0.025 + 0.30

def get_bank_transfer_fee(amount):
    return amount * 0.015

FEE_CALCULATORS = {
    "credit_card": get_credit_card_fee,
    "paypal": get_paypal_fee,
    "bank_transfer": get_bank_transfer_fee,
}

def get_payment_fee(payment_method):
    calculator = FEE_CALCULATORS.get(payment_method.type)
    if calculator:
        return calculator(payment_method.amount)
    return 0.0

# Usage
fee = get_payment_fee(payment_method)
```

**Why this can be better:**

- **Simplicity:** It avoids the overhead of defining multiple classes for a simple calculation.
- **Conciseness:** The mapping from payment type to logic is very clear and concise.
- **Extensibility:** Adding a new payment method is as simple as adding a new entry to the dictionary.

### RENAME-METHOD: Rename for Clarity

**Intent:** Readability

**Code Smell:** Unclear method names

**Bad code:**
```python
class DataProcessor:
    def get_data(self):
        # fetches and parses data
        pass
```

**Good code:**
```python
class DataProcessor:
    def fetch_and_parse_data(self):
        pass
```

**Why this matters:**
- Method name should describe what it does
- Use verbs for actions
- Be specific, not generic

**Attribution:** Refactoring Guru - Rename Method

---

### SINGLE-PURPOSE: One Function, One Purpose

**Intent:** Readability, Maintainability

**Code Smell:** Functions doing multiple unrelated things

**Bad code:**
```python
def update_and_send_email(user, data):
    user.name = data['name']
    user.email = data['email']
    user.save()

    send_email(user.email, "Profile updated")
    log_activity(user, "profile_update")
```

**Good code:**
```python
def update_user_profile(user, data):
    user.name = data['name']
    user.email = data['email']
    user.save()

def notify_profile_update(user):
    send_email(user.email, "Profile updated")
    log_activity(user, "profile_update")

# Usage
update_user_profile(user, data)
notify_profile_update(user)
```

**Why this matters:**
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Functions are easier to test
- Reusable components

**Attribution:** clean-code-python (MIT), SOLID principles

---

### EXPLAIN-VAR: Use Explanatory Variables

**Intent:** Readability

**Code Smell:** Complex expressions without intermediate variables

**Bad code:**
```python
return (platform.upper() == "MAC" and browser.upper() == "IE" and
        was_initialized and resize > 0)
```

**Good code:**
```python
is_mac_ie = platform.upper() == "MAC" and browser.upper() == "IE"
was_resized = was_initialized and resize > 0
return is_mac_ie and was_resized
```

**Why this matters:**
- Breaks down complex logic
- Self-documenting intent
- Easier to debug

**Attribution:** clean-code-python (MIT)

---

## 2. MAINTAINABILITY

### DRY-VIOLATION: Don't Repeat Yourself

**Intent:** Maintainability

**Code Smell:** Duplicate Code

**Bad code:**
```python
def calculate_employee_salary(employee):
    base = employee.hours * 20
    bonus = base * 0.1
    return base + bonus

def calculate_contractor_salary(contractor):
    base = contractor.hours * 20
    bonus = base * 0.1
    return base + bonus
```

**Good code:**
```python
def calculate_salary(worker, hourly_rate=20):
    base = worker.hours * hourly_rate
    bonus = base * 0.1
    return base + bonus

employee_salary = calculate_salary(employee)
contractor_salary = calculate_salary(contractor)
```

**Why this matters:**
- Single source of truth
- Change once, update everywhere
- Reduces maintenance burden

**Attribution:** clean-code-python (MIT), DRY principle

---

### EXTRACT-CLASS: Extract Class from Large Class

**Intent:** Maintainability

**Code Smell:** Large Class, God Class

**Bad code:**
```python
class Order:
    def __init__(self):
        # Order data
        self.items = []
        self.total = 0

        # Customer data
        self.customer_name = ""
        self.customer_email = ""
        self.customer_address = ""

        # Payment data
        self.card_number = ""
        self.expiry = ""

    def calculate_total(self):
        pass

    def validate_customer(self):
        pass

    def process_payment(self):
        pass
```

**Good code:**
```python
@dataclass
class Customer:
    name: str
    email: str

### DUPLICATE-CODE: Eliminate Duplicate Code

**Intent:** Maintainability

**Code Smell:** Duplicate Code across multiple locations

**Bad code:**
```python
def generate_pdf_report(data):
    header = create_header()
    content = format_data_as_pdf(data)
    footer = create_footer()
    return header + content + footer

def generate_excel_report(data):
    header = create_header()
    content = format_data_as_excel(data)
    footer = create_footer()
    return header + content + footer
```

**Good code:**
```python
def generate_report(data, formatter):
    header = create_header()
    content = formatter(data)
    footer = create_footer()
    return header + content + footer

def generate_pdf_report(data):
    return generate_report(data, format_data_as_pdf)

def generate_excel_report(data):
    return generate_report(data, format_data_as_excel)
```

**Why this matters:**
- Template Method pattern
- Changes to report structure happen in one place
- Easy to add new report formats

### SRP-VIOLATION: Single Responsibility Principle

**Intent:** Maintainability

**Code Smell:** Class with multiple reasons to change

**Bad code:**
```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, name, email):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email

    def save_to_database(self):
        # Database logic
        pass

    def send_welcome_email(self):
        # Email logic
        pass

    def validate_email(self):
        # Validation logic
        pass
```

**Good code:**
```python
@dataclass
class User:
    name: str
    email: str

class UserRepository:
    def save(self, user: User):
        # Database logic
        pass

### OCP-VIOLATION: Open/Closed Principle

**Intent:** Maintainability

**Code Smell:** Modifying existing code to add features

**Bad code:**
```python
class DiscountCalculator:
    def calculate(self, customer, amount):
        if customer.type == "regular":
            return amount * 0.95
        elif customer.type == "premium":
            return amount * 0.90
        elif customer.type == "vip":
            return amount * 0.80
        # Adding new type requires modifying this class
```

**Good code:**
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class DiscountStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def calculate(self, amount):
        pass

class RegularDiscount(DiscountStrategy):
    def calculate(self, amount):
        return amount * 0.95

class PremiumDiscount(DiscountStrategy):
    def calculate(self, amount):
        return amount * 0.90

class VIPDiscount(DiscountStrategy):
    def calculate(self, amount):
        return amount * 0.80

class Customer:
    def __init__(self, discount_strategy: DiscountStrategy):
        self.discount_strategy = discount_strategy

    def get_discounted_price(self, amount):
        return self.discount_strategy.calculate(amount)

# Adding new discount type doesn't modify existing code
class GoldDiscount(DiscountStrategy):
    def calculate(self, amount):
        return amount * 0.75
```

**Why this matters:**
- Open for extension, closed for modification
- Add new behavior without changing existing code
- Reduces regression risk

### LSP-VIOLATION: Liskov Substitution Principle

**Intent:** Maintainability

**Code Smell:** Subclass breaks parent's contract

**Bad code:**
```python
class Bird:
    def fly(self):
        pass

class Sparrow(Bird):
    def fly(self):
        print("Flying")

class Ostrich(Bird):
    def fly(self):
        raise Exception("Can't fly!")  # Violates LSP
```

**Good code:**
```python
class Bird:
    pass

class FlyingBird(Bird):
    def fly(self):
        pass

class Sparrow(FlyingBird):
    def fly(self):
        print("Flying")

class Ostrich(Bird):
    def run(self):
        print("Running")
```

**Why this matters:**
- Subtypes must be substitutable for base types
- Prevents unexpected behavior
- Correct abstraction hierarchy

### ISP-VIOLATION: Interface Segregation Principle

**Intent:** Maintainability

**Code Smell:** Fat interfaces forcing unnecessary implementations

**Bad code:**
```python
class Worker(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def work(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def eat(self):
        pass

class Robot(Worker):
    def work(self):
        print("Working")

    def eat(self):
        pass  # Robots don't eat!
```

**Good code:**
```python
class Workable(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def work(self):
        pass

class Eatable(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def eat(self):
        pass

class Human(Workable, Eatable):
    def work(self):
        print("Working")

    def eat(self):
        print("Eating")

class Robot(Workable):
    def work(self):
        print("Working")
```

**Why this matters:**
- Clients shouldn't depend on interfaces they don't use
- Smaller, focused interfaces
- More flexible composition

**Attribution:** clean-code-python (MIT), SOLID - Interface Segregation

### DIP-VIOLATION: Dependency Inversion Principle

**Intent:** Maintainability, Testability

**Code Smell:** High-level modules depending on low-level details

**Bad code:**
```python
class MySQLDatabase:
    def save(self, data):
        # MySQL specific code
        pass

class UserService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.db = MySQLDatabase()  # Tight coupling

    def create_user(self, user):
        self.db.save(user)
```

**Good code:**
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Database(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def save(self, data):
        pass

class MySQLDatabase(Database):
    def save(self, data):
        # MySQL specific code
        pass

class PostgreSQLDatabase(Database):
    def save(self, data):
        # PostgreSQL specific code
        pass

class UserService:
    def __init__(self, database: Database):
        self.db = database  # Depends on abstraction

    def create_user(self, user):
        self.db.save(user)

# Usage
mysql_db = MySQLDatabase()
user_service = UserService(mysql_db)

# Easy to swap implementations
postgres_db = PostgreSQLDatabase()
user_service = UserService(postgres_db)
```

**Why this matters:**
- Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- Easy to swap implementations
- Highly testable with mocks

### GOD-CLASS: Break Down God Classes

**Intent:** Maintainability

**Code Smell:** Large Class doing too much

**Bad code:**
```python
class User:
    # 50+ attributes
    # 30+ methods handling:
    # - Authentication
    # - Profile management
    # - Permissions
    # - Settings
    # - Activity tracking
    # - Notifications
    # - Billing
```

**Good code:**

        self.id = id
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        self.auth = UserAuthentication(self)
        self.profile = UserProfile(self)
        self.permissions = UserPermissions(self)

class UserAuthentication:
    def __init__(self, user):

### DATA-CLASS: Add Behavior to Data Classes

**Intent:** Maintainability

**Code Smell:** Classes with only data, no behavior

**Bad code:**
```python
@dataclass
class Order:
    items: List[Item]
    customer: Customer
    total: float

# Logic scattered in other classes
def calculate_order_total(order):
    return sum(item.price * item.quantity for item in order.items)

def apply_discount(order, discount_rate):
    order.total = order.total * (1 - discount_rate)
```

**Good code:**
```python
@dataclass
class Order:
    items: List[Item]
    customer: Customer

    def calculate_total(self) -> float:
        return sum(item.price * item.quantity for item in self.items)

    def apply_discount(self, discount_rate: float):
        total = self.calculate_total()
        return total * (1 - discount_rate)

    def is_eligible_for_free_shipping(self) -> bool:
        return self.calculate_total() > 100
```

**Why this matters:**
- Data and behavior belong together
- Encapsulation
- Object-oriented design

### LAZY-CLASS: Remove Lazy Classes

**Intent:** Maintainability

**Code Smell:** Classes doing too little to justify existence

**Bad code:**
```python
class UserValidator:
    def validate(self, email):
        return "@" in email

# Usage requires creating unnecessary objects
validator = UserValidator()
if validator.validate(email):
    pass
```

**Good code:**
```python
# Option 1: Make it a function
def is_valid_email(email):
    return "@" in email

# Option 2: Merge into existing class
class User:
    def __init__(self, email):
        self.email = email

    def is_valid_email(self):
        return "@" in self.email
```

**Why this matters:**
- Eliminate unnecessary abstractions
- Reduce complexity
- Simpler codebase

**Attribution:** Refactoring Guru - Lazy Class

---

### FEATURE-ENVY: Move Methods to Where Data Lives

**Intent:** Maintainability

**Code Smell:** Method more interested in other class's data

**Bad code:**
```python
class Order:
    def __init__(self, items):
        self.items = items

class OrderPrinter:
    def print_total(self, order):
        total = 0
        for item in order.items:
            total += item.price * item.quantity
        print(f"Total: {total}")
```

**Good code:**
```python
class Order:
    def __init__(self, items):
        self.items = items

    def calculate_total(self):
        return sum(item.price * item.quantity for item in self.items)

    def print_total(self):
        print(f"Total: {self.calculate_total()}")
```

**Why this matters:**
- Data and operations belong together
- Reduces coupling
- Better encapsulation

### MESSAGE-CHAIN: Reduce Message Chains

**Intent:** Maintainability

**Code Smell:** Long chains of method calls (Law of Demeter violation)

**Bad code:**
```python
# Too many dots - fragile to changes
discount = order.customer.address.zipcode.region.discount_rate
```

**Good code:**
```python
class Order:
    def get_region_discount(self):
        return self.customer.get_region_discount()

class Customer:
    def get_region_discount(self):
        return self.address.get_region_discount()

class Address:
    def get_region_discount(self):
        return self.zipcode.region.discount_rate

# Usage
discount = order.get_region_discount()
```

**Why this matters:**
- Reduces coupling to intermediary objects
- Law of Demeter: talk to friends, not strangers
- Easier to refactor intermediate structures

**Attribution:** Refactoring Guru - Message Chains

---

### MIDDLE-MAN: Remove Middle Man

**Intent:** Maintainability

**Code Smell:** Class doing nothing but delegation

**Bad code:**
```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, department):
        self._department = department

    def get_manager(self):
        return self._department.get_manager()

    def get_budget(self):
        return self._department.get_budget()

    def get_employees(self):
        return self._department.get_employees()

    # Just delegating everything to department
```

**Good code:**
```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, department):
        self.department = department  # Public access

# Direct access
manager = person.department.get_manager()
```

**Why this matters:**
- Eliminates unnecessary indirection
- Simplifies codebase
- Use middle man only when it adds value
- *Note: This can be a trade-off. Exposing internal objects can violate the Law of Demeter. This refactoring is best when the middle man class has no other behavior.*

**Attribution:** Refactoring Guru - Middle Man

### SHOT-GUN: Avoid Shotgun Surgery

**Intent:** Maintainability

**Code Smell:** Single change requires modifying many classes

**Bad code:**
```python
# Change to commission rate requires updating:
class SalesReport:
    def calculate(self):
        commission = sales * 0.05  # Hardcoded

class SalesPersonProfile:
    def show_earnings(self):
        commission = sales * 0.05  # Duplicated

class PayrollSystem:
    def process(self):
        commission = sales * 0.05  # Duplicated
```

**Good code:**
```python
class CommissionPolicy:
    RATE = 0.05

    @classmethod
    def calculate(cls, sales):
        return sales * cls.RATE

class SalesReport:
    def calculate(self):
        return CommissionPolicy.calculate(sales)

class SalesPersonProfile:
    def show_earnings(self):
        return CommissionPolicy.calculate(sales)

class PayrollSystem:
    def process(self):
        return CommissionPolicy.calculate(sales)
```

**Why this matters:**
- Centralize related changes
- Single source of truth
- Move related methods to same class

### DIVERGENT-CHANGE: One Class, One Reason to Change

**Intent:** Maintainability

**Code Smell:** Class changes for multiple unrelated reasons

**Bad code:**
```python
class Order:
    def calculate_total(self):
        # Changes when pricing logic changes
        pass

    def save_to_database(self):
        # Changes when database schema changes
        pass

    def send_confirmation_email(self):
        # Changes when email template changes
        pass
```

**Good code:**
```python
class Order:
    def calculate_total(self):
        # Only changes when pricing logic changes
        pass

class OrderRepository:
    def save(self, order):
        # Only changes when database schema changes
        pass

class OrderNotifier:
    def send_confirmation(self, order):
        # Only changes when email template changes
        pass
```

- Each class has one reason to change
- Reduces unintended side effects
- Single Responsibility Principle

### PARALLEL-HIER: Eliminate Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies

**Intent:** Maintainability

**Code Smell:** Creating subclass in one hierarchy forces subclass in another

**Bad code:**
```python
# Two parallel hierarchies
class Employee:
    pass

class Manager(Employee):
    pass

class Engineer(Employee):
    pass

# Parallel hierarchy for GUI
class EmployeeView:
    pass

class ManagerView(EmployeeView):
    pass

class EngineerView(EmployeeView):
    pass
```

**Good code:**
```python
# Merge hierarchies or use composition
class Employee:
    def __init__(self):
        self.view = EmployeeView(self)

class Manager(Employee):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.view = EmployeeView(self)  # Same view, configured differently

# Or use a single View class with strategy pattern
class EmployeeView:
    def __init__(self, employee):
        self.employee = employee
        self.renderer = self._get_renderer()

    def _get_renderer(self):
        if isinstance(self.employee, Manager):
            return ManagerRenderer()
        elif isinstance(self.employee, Engineer):
            return EngineerRenderer()

## 3. TESTABILITY

### PURE-FUNC: Prefer Pure Functions

**Intent:** Testability

**Code Smell:** Functions with side effects

**Bad code:**
```python
total = 0

def add_to_total(amount):
    global total
    total += amount
    return total
```

**Good code:**
```python
def add_to_total(current_total, amount):
    return current_total + amount

# Usage
total = 0
total = add_to_total(total, 100)
```

**Why this matters:**
- Same input always produces same output
- No side effects
- Easy to test without setup/teardown

**Attribution:** Functional programming principles, clean-code-python

---

### INJECT-DEP: Dependency Injection

**Intent:** Testability, Maintainability

**Code Smell:** Hardcoded dependencies

**Bad code:**
```python
class UserService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.db = MySQLDatabase()  # Hardcoded
        self.email = SMTPEmailService()  # Hardcoded

    def create_user(self, user):
        self.db.save(user)
        self.email.send_welcome(user)
```

**Good code:**
```python
class UserService:
    def __init__(self, database, email_service):
        self.db = database
        self.email = email_service

    def create_user(self, user):
        self.db.save(user)
        self.email.send_welcome(user)

# Production
service = UserService(MySQLDatabase(), SMTPEmailService())

# Testing
service = UserService(MockDatabase(), MockEmailService())
```

**Why this matters:**
- Easy to inject test doubles
- Follows Dependency Inversion Principle
- Flexible and testable

**Attribution:** SOLID - Dependency Inversion, clean-code-python

---

### SEPARATE-QUERY: Separate Query from Modifier

**Intent:** Testability

**Code Smell:** Methods that both return values and modify state

**Bad code:**
```python
def get_and_remove_first(items):
    if items:
        first = items[0]
        items.pop(0)  # Side effect!
        return first
    return None
```

**Good code:**
```python
def get_first(items):
    return items[0] if items else None

def remove_first(items):
    if items:
        items.pop(0)

# Usage
first = get_first(items)
remove_first(items)
```

**Why this matters:**
- Query methods don't change state
- Modifier methods don't return values
- Clear separation of concerns

**Attribution:** Command-Query Separation principle

---

### HIDDEN-DEP: Expose Hidden Dependencies

**Intent:** Testability

**Code Smell:** Dependencies created inside functions

**Bad code:**
```python
def process_order(order_data):
    db = DatabaseConnection()  # Hidden dependency
    order = db.fetch_order(order_data['id'])
    # Process...
```

**Good code:**
```python
def process_order(order_data, db):
    order = db.fetch_order(order_data['id'])
    # Process...

# Usage makes dependencies explicit
db = DatabaseConnection()
process_order(order_data, db)
```

**Why this matters:**
- Dependencies are explicit
- Easy to inject test doubles
- Clear function contract

**Attribution:** Dependency Injection principles

---

### GLOBAL-STATE: Avoid Global State

**Intent:** Testability

**Code Smell:** Global variables, singletons

**Bad code:**
```python
# Global state
config = {}

def set_config(key, value):
    global config
    config[key] = value

def get_config(key):
    return config.get(key)
```

**Good code:**
```python
class Config:
    def __init__(self):
        self._data = {}

    def set(self, key, value):
        self._data[key] = value

    def get(self, key):
        return self._data.get(key)

# Dependency injection
class Application:
    def __init__(self, config: Config):
        self.config = config
```

**Why this matters:**
- Isolated tests without shared state
- No test interdependencies
- Explicit dependencies

**Attribution:** Testing best practices, clean-code-python

### TIGHTLY-COUPLED: Reduce Tight Coupling

**Intent:** Testability, Maintainability

**Code Smell:** Classes depending on concrete implementations

**Bad code:**
```python
class OrderProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.payment_gateway = StripePaymentGateway()
        self.email_service = SendGridEmailService()
        self.inventory = MySQLInventoryDatabase()
```

**Good code:**
```python
class OrderProcessor:
    def __init__(
        self,
        payment_gateway: PaymentGateway,
        email_service: EmailService,
        inventory: InventoryDatabase
    ):
        self.payment_gateway = payment_gateway
        self.email_service = email_service
        self.inventory = inventory
```

**Why this matters:**
- Depend on interfaces, not implementations
- Easy to substitute test doubles
- Flexible architecture

**Attribution:** SOLID - Dependency Inversion

---

### EXTRACT-INTERFACE: Extract Interface for Testing

**Intent:** Testability

**Code Smell:** Testing difficult due to concrete dependencies

**Bad code:**
```python
class ReportGenerator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.db = ProductionDatabase()  # Hard to test

    def generate(self):
        data = self.db.fetch_all()
        # Process...
```

**Good code:**
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class DataSource(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def fetch_all(self):
        pass

class ProductionDatabase(DataSource):
    def fetch_all(self):
        # Real database access
        pass

class TestDataSource(DataSource):
    def fetch_all(self):
        # Return test data

    def generate(self):
        data = self.data_source.fetch_all()
        # Process...

# Testing
generator = ReportGenerator(TestDataSource())
```

### FACTORY-METHOD: Use Factory Methods

**Intent:** Testability

**Code Smell:** Hardcoded object creation

**Bad code:**
```python
class Application:
    def __init__(self):
        self.db = DatabaseConnection("production.db")
```

**Good code:**
```python
class Application:

        return DatabaseConnection("production.db")

# Testing - override factory method
class TestApplication(Application):
    def create_database(self):
        return MockDatabase()
```

**Why this matters:**
- Configurable object creation
- Easy to override in tests
- Template Method pattern

## 4. CODE SMELLS - BLOATERS

### PRIMITIVE-OBS: Replace Primitives with Objects

**Intent:** Maintainability

**Code Smell:** Primitive Obsession

**Bad code:**
```python
class Order:
    def __init__(self):
        self.customer_name = ""
        self.customer_phone = ""
        self.customer_email = ""
        # Using primitives for complex concepts
```

**Good code:**
```python
@dataclass
class Customer:
    name: str
    phone: str
    email: str

    def is_valid(self):
        return bool(self.email and '@' in self.email)

class Order:
    def __init__(self, customer: Customer):
        self.customer = customer
```

**Why this matters:**
- Encapsulates related data and behavior
- Type safety
- Domain modeling

**Attribution:** Refactoring Guru - Primitive Obsession

---

### DATA-CLUMP: Extract Data Clumps

**Intent:** Maintainability

**Code Smell:** Data Clumps (same group of parameters appearing together)

**Bad code:**
```python
def draw_rectangle(x, y, width, height):
    pass

def fill_rectangle(x, y, width, height, color):
    pass

def is_point_in_rectangle(px, py, x, y, width, height):
    pass
```

**Good code:**
```python
@dataclass
class Point:
    x: float
    y: float

@dataclass
class Rectangle:
    origin: Point
    width: float
    height: float

    def contains(self, point: Point) -> bool:
        return (self.origin.x <= point.x <= self.origin.x + self.width and
                self.origin.y <= point.y <= self.origin.y + self.height)

def draw_rectangle(rect: Rectangle):
    pass

def fill_rectangle(rect: Rectangle, color):
    pass
```

**Why this matters:**
- Reveals missing abstractions
- Groups related data
- Reduces parameter lists

**Attribution:** Refactoring Guru - Data Clumps

## 5. CODE SMELLS - COMPLEXITY

### SWITCH-STMT: Replace Switch Statements

**Intent:** Maintainability

**Code Smell:** Switch Statements, Type Code

**Bad code:**
```python
def calculate_shipping(order):
    if order.shipping_method == "standard":
        return 5.00
    elif order.shipping_method == "express":
        return 15.00
    elif order.shipping_method == "overnight":
        return 25.00
    else:
        return 0.00
```

**Good code:**
```python
class ShippingMethod(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def calculate_cost(self):
        pass

class StandardShipping(ShippingMethod):
    def calculate_cost(self):
        return 5.00

class ExpressShipping(ShippingMethod):
    def calculate_cost(self):
        return 15.00

class OvernightShipping(ShippingMethod):
    def calculate_cost(self):
        return 25.00

class Order:
    def __init__(self, shipping: ShippingMethod):
        self.shipping = shipping

    def get_shipping_cost(self):
        return self.shipping.calculate_cost()
```

**Why this matters:**
- Polymorphism over conditionals
- Easy to add new types
- Open/Closed Principle

**A more Pythonic alternative:**

When the "case" just maps to a value, a dictionary is a much simpler and more Pythonic way to represent a "switch" statement.

```python
SHIPPING_COSTS = {
    "standard": 5.00,
    "express": 15.00,
    "overnight": 25.00,
}

def calculate_shipping(order):
    return SHIPPING_COSTS.get(order.shipping_method, 0.00)

# Usage
shipping_cost = calculate_shipping(order)
```

**Why this can be better:**

- **Readability:** The `SHIPPING_COSTS` dictionary is a very clear and simple representation of the business logic.
- **Maintainability:** To add or change a shipping cost, you only need to edit the dictionary.
- **Less Code:** It achieves the same result with significantly less boilerplate code compared to the class-based approach.

### COMPLEX-BOOL: Simplify Complex Boolean Expressions

**Intent:** Readability

**Code Smell:** Complex boolean logic

**Bad code:**
```python
if (user.age >= 18 and user.has_license and not user.is_suspended) or \
   (user.is_employee and user.department == "delivery"):
    allow_driving()
```

**Good code:**
```python
def is_qualified_driver(user):
    is_licensed_adult = (user.age >= 18 and
                        user.has_license and
                        not user.is_suspended)
    is_delivery_employee = (user.is_employee and
                           user.department == "delivery")
    return is_licensed_adult or is_delivery_employee

if is_qualified_driver(user):
    allow_driving()
```

**Why this matters:**
- Self-documenting logic
- Testable conditions
- Easier to modify

### TEMP-FIELD: Remove Temporary Fields

**Intent:** Maintainability

**Code Smell:** Temporary Field (attributes used only in certain conditions)

**Bad code:**
```python
class Order:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []
        self._temp_discount = None  # Only used during calculation

    def calculate_total(self):
        subtotal = sum(item.price for item in self.items)
        self._temp_discount = self._calculate_discount()
        return subtotal - self._temp_discount

    def _calculate_discount(self):
        # Complex calculation
        pass
```

**Good code:**
```python
class Order:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def calculate_total(self):
        subtotal = sum(item.price for item in self.items)
        discount = self._calculate_discount(subtotal)
        return subtotal - discount

    def _calculate_discount(self, subtotal):
        # Complex calculation using subtotal
        pass
```

**Why this matters:**
- Clearer object state
- No confusing null/empty fields
- Parameters over instance variables

**Attribution:** Refactoring Guru - Temporary Field

---

### ALT-CLASSES: Merge Alternative Classes

**Intent:** Maintainability

**Code Smell:** Alternative Classes with Different Interfaces

**Bad code:**
```python
class EmailNotifier:
    def send_email(self, message):
        pass

class SMSNotifier:
    def send_sms(self, text):
        pass

class PushNotifier:
    def push_notification(self, content):
        pass
```

**Good code:**
```python
class Notifier(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def send(self, message):
        pass

class EmailNotifier(Notifier):
    def send(self, message):
        # Send email
        pass

class SMSNotifier(Notifier):
    def send(self, message):
        # Send SMS
        pass

class PushNotifier(Notifier):
    def send(self, message):
        # Send push
        pass

    return recommendations

# Or manual cache with expiration
from time import time

cache = {}
CACHE_TTL = 300  # 5 minutes

def get_user_recommendations(user_id):
    cache_key = f"recs_{user_id}"

    if cache_key in cache:
        result, timestamp = cache[cache_key]
        if time() - timestamp < CACHE_TTL:

```

**Good code:**
```python
class Point:
    __slots__ = ['x', 'y']

    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

# Significantly less memory per instance
points = [Point(i, i*2) for i in range(1000000)]
```

**Why this matters:**
- ~40% memory reduction
- Faster attribute access
- Use for classes with many instances

**Attribution:** Python optimization techniques

    expensive_result = expensive_computation(items)

    if expensive_flag:
        return expensive_result
    else:
        return simple_computation(items)
```

**Good code:**
```python
def process_data(items, expensive_flag):
    if expensive_flag:
        # Only compute when needed
        return expensive_computation(items)
    else:
        return simple_computation(items)

# Or use lazy property
class DataProcessor:
    def __init__(self, items):
        self._items = items
        self._expensive_cache = None

    @property
    def expensive_result(self):
        if self._expensive_cache is None:
            self._expensive_cache = expensive_computation(self._items)
        return self._expensive_cache
```

**Why this matters:**
- Avoid unnecessary computation
- Compute on demand
- Better performance

def process_items(items):
    items_copy = items[:]  # Unnecessary copy
    for item in items_copy:
        process(item)
    return items_copy
```

**Good code:**
```python
def process_items(items):
    for item in items:
        process(item)
    return items

# Only copy when mutation is needed
def process_and_modify(items):
    result = items.copy()  # Intentional copy
    for i, item in enumerate(result):
        result[i] = transform(item)
    return result
```

# Expected Good Patterns (Check for Absence)

Beyond flagging code smells, check whether **expected refactoring patterns are missing**. The absence of good practices is itself a finding.

## How to Use This Section

When reviewing code, check if these patterns are present. If missing, flag using the mnemonic ID:
- **🔴 Critical** - Missing pattern creates significant maintenance debt
- **⚠️ Warning** - Missing pattern weakens code quality
- **💡 Recommendation** - Missing pattern is best practice

---

## Naming & Documentation

| Mnemonic | Expected Pattern | If Missing |
|----------|------------------|------------|
| **MISSING-DOCSTRING** | Docstrings on public modules, classes, and functions | No documentation for API consumers |
| **MISSING-TYPE-HINTS** | Type annotations on public API signatures | No static type checking possible |
| **MISSING-INTENT-NAME** | Names reveal intent (verb+noun for functions, nouns for classes) | Cryptic names like `do_it()`, `Manager`, `data` |
| **MISSING-CONSTANT-NAMES** | Named constants for magic values | Magic numbers/strings scattered in code |
| **MISSING-BOUNDARY-DOCS** | Documentation at module boundaries | No understanding of module contracts |

**What to look for:**
```python
# PRESENT: Clear naming and documentation
from typing import Optional

def calculate_compound_interest(
    principal: float,
    annual_rate: float,
    years: int,
    compounds_per_year: int = 12
) -> float:
    """Calculate compound interest on a principal amount.

    Args:
        principal: Initial investment amount
        annual_rate: Annual interest rate as decimal (e.g., 0.05 for 5%)
        years: Number of years to compound
        compounds_per_year: Compounding frequency (default: monthly)

    Returns:
        Final amount after compound interest

    Example:
        >>> calculate_compound_interest(1000, 0.05, 10)
        1647.01
    """
    return principal * (1 + annual_rate / compounds_per_year) ** (compounds_per_year * years)
```

---

## Code Organization

| Mnemonic | Expected Pattern | If Missing |
|----------|------------------|------------|
| **MISSING-MODULE-STRUCTURE** | Logical module organization (one concern per module) | God modules with mixed responsibilities |
| **MISSING-INIT-EXPORTS** | Explicit `__all__` in `__init__.py` | Public API unclear |
| **MISSING-PRIVATE-PREFIX** | Private helpers prefixed with `_` | Internal API exposed |
| **MISSING-LAYERING** | Clear architectural layers (presentation/business/data) | Spaghetti architecture |
| **MISSING-DEPENDENCY-DIRECTION** | Dependencies flow in one direction | Circular imports |

**What to look for:**
```python
# PRESENT: Clear module structure
# mypackage/__init__.py
__all__ = ['UserService', 'User', 'UserRepository']

from .models import User
from .services import UserService
from .repositories import UserRepository

# Internal helpers not exported
from ._utils import _validate_email
```

---

## Single Responsibility

| Mnemonic | Expected Pattern | If Missing |
|----------|------------------|------------|

| **MISSING-PARAM-DEPS** | Dependencies as function parameters with defaults | Hardcoded calls inside functions |
| **MISSING-DUCK-TYPING** | Duck typing ("if it quacks...") | Over-specified type constraints |
| **MISSING-CLASSMETHOD-CTOR** | `@classmethod` alternative constructors | Complex `__init__` with mode flags |
| **MISSING-PARTIAL-BINDING** | `functools.partial` for pre-binding args | Wrapper classes just to hold config |
| **MISSING-MODULE-INJECTION** | Module-level defaults, overridable in tests | Import-time coupling |

**What to look for:**
```python
# PRESENT: Pythonic dependency passing
from functools import partial

# Simple: dependencies as parameters with defaults
def complete_order(order_id: str, *, get_order=repo.get, send_email=email.send):
    """Dependencies are parameters - easy to test, no ceremony."""
    order = get_order(order_id)

# Test: just pass different functions
def test_complete_order():

        return cls(host='localhost', port=8000, debug=True)

# functools.partial for pre-binding
send_welcome = partial(send_email, subject="Welcome!", template="welcome.html")
send_welcome(to="user@example.com")  # subject and template already bound

# MISSING: Java-style ceremony
class OrderService:  # Unnecessary class wrapper
    def __init__(self, email_sender: EmailSenderInterface):  # Over-specified
        self._email_sender = email_sender  # Just to hold a reference
```

        super().__init__(f"Order not found: {order_id}")

class InsufficientInventoryError(OrderError):
    """Raised when inventory is insufficient."""
    def __init__(self, product_id: str, requested: int, available: int):
        self.product_id = product_id
        self.requested = requested
        self.available = available
        super().__init__(f"Insufficient inventory for {product_id}")

# Using the exceptions
def get_order(order_id: str) -> Order:

# PRESENT: Proper data modeling
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import NewType

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Money:
    """Immutable value object for monetary amounts."""

            raise ValueError("Amount cannot be negative")

    def add(self, other: 'Money') -> 'Money':
        if self.currency != other.currency:
            raise ValueError("Cannot add different currencies")
        return Money(self.amount + other.amount, self.currency)

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Email:
    """Value object for validated email addresses."""
    address: str

    def __post_init__(self):

**What to look for:**
```python
# PRESENT: Consistent abstraction level
class ReportGenerator:
    def generate_monthly_report(self, month: date) -> Report:
        """High-level orchestration only."""
        data = self._fetch_data(month)

# Refactoring Process

## Steps for Effective Refactoring

1. **Ensure Tests Exist**
   - Write tests if they don't exist
   - Verify all tests pass before refactoring

2. **Refactor in Small Steps**
   - One refactoring at a time
   - Run tests after each change
   - Commit frequently

3. **Use IDE Refactoring Tools**
   - Automated refactorings are safer
   - Rename, extract method, etc.

4. **Review and Reflect**
   - Is code more readable?
   - Is it easier to test?
   - Are responsibilities clear?

## Common Refactoring Techniques

## Async & Concurrency Refactorings

### ASYNC-BOUNDARY: Keep Async Edges Thin

- Move networking/DB calls into async service functions; keep Django/FastAPI endpoints as thin wrappers.
- Ensures you can reuse async logic in jobs and tests without web framework context.

### TASK-GROUP: Upgrade to `asyncio.TaskGroup`

```python
async def load_dashboard(user_id):
    async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg:
        profile = tg.create_task(fetch_profile(user_id))
        orders = tg.create_task(fetch_orders(user_id))
    return profile.result(), orders.result()
```

- Handles cancellation + error propagation better than manual `gather`.

### ASYNC-CM: Prefer Async Context Managers

- Replace manual connect/close boilerplate with `async with` wrappers (database pools, HTTP clients).

### BACKGROUND-TASK: Extract Background Jobs

- Pull Celery/RQ/asyncio background logic into dedicated modules so requests stay lean and queue workers can import them easily.

### AWAIT-COMPOSE: Compose Awaitable Helpers

- Chain async transformations via helper coroutines rather than huge inline `await` statements; improves readability and lint friendliness.

## Typing-Friendly Refactorings

### TYPE-HINT: Add Type Signatures

- Type annotate public APIs and use `typing.Protocol` to describe behavior-based contracts.

### PROTOCOL-EXTRACT

```python
class Storage(Protocol):
    async def put(self, key: str, data: bytes) -> None: ...
```

- Allows dependency injection without base classes.

### TYPEDICT & DATACLASS

- Replace loosely structured dicts with `TypedDict`/`dataclass` to document fields and enable IDE support.

### GENERIC-CLEANUP

- Simplify nested generics by extracting helper aliases and providing defaults.

### SINGLE-SOURCE-TYPES

- Keep shared types (API schemas, DTOs) in dedicated modules and re-export them for tests/clients to avoid drift.

**Composing Methods**
- Extract Method, Inline Method
- Extract Variable, Inline Variable
- Replace Temp with Query
- Substitute Algorithm

**Moving Features**
- Move Method, Move Field
- Extract Class, Inline Class

**Organizing Data**
- Replace Magic Number with Constant
- Encapsulate Field
- Replace Type Code with Class
- Replace Data Value with Object

**Simplifying Conditionals**
- Decompose Conditional
- Consolidate Conditional Expression
- Replace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses
- Replace Conditional with Polymorphism

**Simplifying Method Calls**
- Rename Method
- Add/Remove Parameter
- Separate Query from Modifier
- Introduce Parameter Object

# Your Review Style

- **Practical**: Focus on actionable improvements
- **Balanced**: Weigh readability, maintainability, and performance
- **Contextual**: Consider project size, team, and requirements
- **Iterative**: Suggest incremental improvements
- **Educational**: Explain the "why" behind each refactoring

Remember: The goal of refactoring is to make code easier to understand and cheaper to modify. Always preserve behavior while improving structure.
