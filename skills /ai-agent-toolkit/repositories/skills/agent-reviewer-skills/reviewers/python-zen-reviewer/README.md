# Zen of Python Code Reviewer Skill

A Claude Code skill that reviews Python code against the 19 principles of the Zen of Python (PEP 20) to ensure Pythonic, readable, and maintainable code.

## What This Skill Does

This skill transforms Claude into a Zen of Python expert who:
- Reviews code against all 19 Zen of Python principles
- Identifies violations of Pythonic style and philosophy
- Suggests improvements aligned with Python's design philosophy
- Provides concrete before/after examples following PEP 20
- Promotes beautiful, explicit, simple, and readable code
- References Tim Peters' original Zen of Python aphorisms

## Installation

Use the [repository-wide installer](../../README.md#installation-and-use) and pass this reviewer directory name to `--skill`.

## How to Use

Simply ask Claude to review your Python code for Pythonic style:

```
"Review this code against the Zen of Python"
"Is this code Pythonic?"
"Check this against PEP 20"
"Make this code more Pythonic"
"Review for Python philosophy violations"
"Apply Zen of Python principles"
```

The skill will automatically activate based on keywords like:
- Zen of Python, Pythonic, PEP 20
- Python philosophy, Python style
- idiomatic Python, beautiful code
- explicit, simple, readable

## What You'll Get

A structured Zen of Python review with:
- ✅ **Pythonic Strengths** - What follows Zen principles (with mnemonic IDs)
- 🐍 **Zen of Python Recommendations** - Violations with principle + mnemonic ID (e.g., **EXPLICIT: ZEN-TYPE-HINTS**)
- **Before/After Code** - Concrete Pythonic refactoring examples
- **Zen Principle Quoted** - The relevant PEP 20 aphorism
- **Why This Matters** - How it aligns with Python philosophy

### Example Review

````markdown
## Zen of Python Review: user_manager.py

### ✅ Pythonic Strengths
- **ZEN-CONTEXT**: Properly uses context manager for file operations (lines 45-47)
- **ZEN-ENUMERATE**: Uses enumerate() for indexed iteration (line 62)

### 🐍 Zen of Python Recommendations

#### EXPLICIT: ZEN-TYPE-HINTS - Add Type Hints for Clarity

**Current code:**
```python
def process_users(users, filter_active):
    return [u for u in users if u.active == filter_active]
```

**Pythonic code:**
```python
def process_users(users: list[User], filter_active: bool) -> list[User]:
    """Filter users by active status."""
    return [user for user in users if user.active == filter_active]
```

**Why this matters:**
Type hints make function contracts explicit, improve IDE support, and enable static type checking with mypy. They serve as inline documentation for other developers.

**Zen principle:**
> "Explicit is better than implicit."

---

#### SIMPLE: ZEN-BUILTIN - Use Built-in Functions

**Current code:**
```python
def calculate_total(prices):
    total = 0
    for price in prices:
        total += price
    return total
```

**Pythonic code:**
```python
def calculate_total(prices: list[float]) -> float:
    """Calculate sum of all prices."""
    return sum(prices)
```

**Why this matters:**
Python's built-in sum() is optimized, well-tested, and immediately recognizable to Python developers. Simple solutions using built-ins are preferred over manual implementations.

**Zen principle:**
> "Simple is better than complex."

## The 19 Zen of Python Principles

```python
>>> import this
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```
