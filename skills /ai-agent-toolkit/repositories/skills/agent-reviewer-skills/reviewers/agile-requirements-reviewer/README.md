# Agile Requirements & Specification Reviewer

A comprehensive Claude Code skill for reviewing software specifications, user stories, and use cases using agile requirements best practices, business analysis principles, and requirements engineering standards.

## 🎯 What This Skill Reviews

This skill analyzes requirements documents, user stories, and use cases for:

### User Story Quality (INVEST Criteria)

- **I**ndependent - Stories can be developed in any order
- **N**egotiable - Details worked out through conversation
- **V**aluable - Clear business or user value
- **E**stimable - Team can estimate the work
- **S**mall - Fits in one iteration/sprint
- **T**estable - Clear acceptance criteria

### Use Case Completeness

- All actors identified (primary, secondary, stakeholders)
- Preconditions and postconditions specified
- Complete main success scenario
- Alternative flows documented
- Exception flows covered
- Data exchanged specified

### Requirements Quality

- Clear, unambiguous language
- Atomic (one requirement per statement)
- Measurable and verifiable
- Free from vague terms ("fast", "user-friendly")
- Testable with observable outcomes
- Traceable to business needs

### Problem Domain Focus

- Describes WHAT, not HOW
- No architecture or design details
- No technology choices
- Uses business language, not technical jargon
- Focuses on external behavior

### Consistency

- Consistent terminology throughout
- No contradicting requirements
- Consistent format and structure
- Business rules aligned
- Valid cross-references

## 📋 Example Review Output

## Requirements Review: Checkout Flow Specification

### ✅ Strengths
- **USE-FLOW**: Main success scenario is detailed and clear (lines 15-35)
- **STORY-ACCEPT**: Acceptance criteria are specific and testable
- **CONS-TERM**: Consistent use of "customer" and "shopping cart" throughout

### ⚠️ Issues Found

#### INVEST-V: User story lacks clear business value

**Current requirement:**

```text
As a user, I want a checkout button so that I can check out.
```

**Suggested improvement:**

```text
As a customer, I want to review my order details and complete payment quickly,
so that I can finalize my purchase with confidence and minimal friction,
reducing cart abandonment and increasing conversion.
```

**Why this matters:**
The business value explains WHY this matters to users and the business. It helps
prioritize features and ensures the team builds the right thing. "Reducing cart
abandonment" provides measurable business value.

**Best practice:**
Every user story must articulate clear value. The "so that" clause should answer
"Why does this matter?" and guide prioritization decisions.

#### REQ-AVOID-VAGUE: Requirement uses unmeasurable terms

**Current requirement:**

```text
The checkout process shall be fast and user-friendly.
```

**Suggested improvement:**

```text
The checkout process shall:
- Complete in 3 steps or fewer from cart to confirmation
- Display each step within 2 seconds of user action
- Show progress indicator (Step 1 of 3, Step 2 of 3, etc.)
- Allow users to navigate back to previous steps without data loss
- Pre-fill known customer information (saved addresses, payment methods)
```

**Why this matters:**
Vague terms like "fast" and "user-friendly" mean different things to different
people and cannot be tested. Specific criteria ensure shared understanding and
enable verification.

**Best practice:**
Replace vague qualitative terms with specific, quantifiable criteria. If you
can't measure it, you can't verify it.

---

#### COMP-ERROR: Missing error condition handling

**Current requirement:**

```text
The user enters payment information and clicks Submit.
The system processes payment and displays confirmation.
```

**Suggested improvement:**

```text
Main Success Scenario:
1. User enters payment information
2. System validates payment information format
3. System processes payment via payment gateway
4. System displays order confirmation with order number

Exception Flow - Invalid Payment Information:
2a. If payment information invalid, display specific error
2b. Highlight invalid fields
2c. Return to step 1

Exception Flow - Payment Declined:
3a. If payment declined, display decline reason
3b. Offer alternative payment method
3c. Return to step 1

Exception Flow - Payment Gateway Timeout:
3a. If payment gateway timeout (>30 seconds), retry up to 2 times
3b. If retries fail, save cart and display error message
3c. Send notification to customer service team
```

**Why this matters:**
Real-world systems must handle errors gracefully. Without specified error handling,
developers make assumptions that may not match user expectations, leading to poor
user experience.

**Best practice:**
For every main flow, identify and document alternative flows (variations) and
exception flows (errors). Use case format makes this explicit.

### 💡 Requirements Wisdom
> "Requirements should focus on WHAT the system must do or a quality it must have,
> not HOW it's built. Stay in the problem domain."

## Installation

Use the [repository-wide installer](../../README.md#installation-and-use) and pass this reviewer directory name to `--skill`.

## 💡 How to Use

Once installed, the skill activates automatically when you request requirements reviews:

```
"Review these user stories for quality"
"Check this specification for completeness"
"Analyze these requirements for consistency"
"Review this use case for missing scenarios"
"Check if these requirements stay in the problem domain"
"Validate these acceptance criteria"
```

Or invoke directly:

```
"Use the agile requirements reviewer on this specification"
"Apply INVEST criteria to these user stories"
```

## 📚 What You'll Learn
